## Lesson: Redux Middleware

##### Discussion

1. What is the role of middleware?

##### Practice

1. Setup Redux Logger together. (https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger)


##### Group Work
Each group must setup a different middleware, and explain how it works to the class. Choose one of the following:

  A) [Redux LocalStorage](https://github.com/elgerlambert/redux-localstorage)
  B) [Redux-DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools)
      - Set up a visual demonstration
  C) [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) for async/multiple dispatches
    - Explain how and why we use Redux-Thunk
  D) [Toast Error Messages](See the bottom of https://www.codementor.io/reactjs/tutorial/beginner-s-guide-to-redux-middleware)
  E) Redux-Debounce / Redux-Throttle
  F) Redux-Authentication (https://github.com/Jackong/redux-authentication)

Group presentations. Students should follow along and ask questions.


##### Self Code

Compose middleware together (http://redux.js.org/docs/api/compose.html)

1. Groupwork - explain curry and compose.
