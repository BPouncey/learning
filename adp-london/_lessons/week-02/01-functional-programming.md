## Objectives

- Use common array methods (`.map`, `.filter`, `.sort`)
- Identify the differences between pure and impure functions, and write code that avoids side effects
- Distinguish between `.forEach` and `.map`
- Distinguish between `.push` and `.concat`
- Use the spread operator (`...`) to avoid array mutation
- Use Object.assign to avoid object mutation
- Write stateless presentational components in React
- Use 'reselect' to write pure functions to capture nested state
