## Pre-Work

Read the following articles before class. Be prepared to discuss why types might be addition to your project.

- [Why TypeScript](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/why-typescript.html)
- [Why you shouldn't be scared of TypeScript](https://scotch.io/tutorials/why-you-shouldnt-be-scared-of-typescript)

---

## Learning Objectives

- Explain how types help you avoid errors in your code
- Setup type checking in your editor and project
- Write effective types, interfaces, and generics for existing code
- Compare ES2015 vs TypeScript for writing modern JavaScript
- Better understand JavaScript Modules by using TypeScript's `namespace`
- Use Webpack to bundle TypeScript code, and work with TypeScript in React
- use `@typings` from npm to install Type Definitions for 3rd party (non-typescript) libraries
- Explain the potential advantages of writing JavaScript programs using TypeScript

## Exercise 1

Compare [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/) with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/repl/) compiled results in ES5.

---

## Exercise 2

Walk-through the different ways of writing types in TypeScript:

- Type inference
- Types
- Interfaces
- Declaration files

---

## Exercise 3

Set up Webpack to load and bundle TypeScript modules, including typescript files
containing React components.

---

## Lab Activity

Now that we understand how to install and use TypeScript, let's convert a project we've built using ES2015
to TypeScript.
