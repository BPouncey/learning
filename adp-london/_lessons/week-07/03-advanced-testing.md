- Stub
- Spy
- Mock
- Code coverage

---

## Exercise 1

Write unit tests for React components in the Worst Pokemon project.

---

## Exercise 2

Write unit tests for action creators and middleware in your Worst Pokemon project.

These tests should use **spies** or **mocks**.

---

## Exercise 3

Setup a test watcher with code-coverage reporting.

---

## Exercise 4
