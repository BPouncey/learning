## Lab Activity

We're going to write tests and some new features for the Gandalf library.
Here's how we'll do it:

```
# Code Along
- Prep Gandalf for unit tests using Jest
- Write a couple unit tests for existing functionality

# On your own
- Use BDD to define some new features
- Use documentation to discover the interface for these new features
- Use TDD to implement the new features
```

When we're done, we'll have useful, documented, and tested new code.
