## Exercise 2

First, let's prepare a MongoDB database with some sample data. [Go here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mongodb/docs-assets/primer-dataset/primer-dataset.json)
and follow the instructions for importing this data into a test database.

We'll need to know a little bit about how to query a mongo database, in order to use Meteor efficently.
First read the [SQL to MongoDB Mapping Chart](https://docs.mongodb.com/master/reference/sql-comparison/).
When your finished, open the MongoDB CRUD operations documentation and get ready to query!
