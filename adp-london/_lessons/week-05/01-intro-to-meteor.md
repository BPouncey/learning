## Exercise 1

Design an Application Platform

- Split into two groups and create your ideal application platform, on paper. Your platform should be
geared towards developers who want to create Web Apps and should include all the necessary components.

- When you've come up with a platform design, then come up with a marketing plan for your platform.
When you have a marketing plan, you'll present it to the class. Your plan should hilight all of the reasons
developers should choose your platform, over their own custom solution.
