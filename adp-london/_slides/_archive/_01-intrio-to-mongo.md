Implicitly created on first insert() operation. The primary key _id is automatically added if _id field is not specified.

db.apple.insert( {
    user_id: "abc123",
    quantity: 55,
    quality: "A"
 } )
However, you can also explicitly create a collection:

db.createCollection("apple")

#2
Collections do not describe or enforce the structure of its documents; i.e. there is no structural alteration at the collection level.

However, at the document level, update() operations can add fields to existing documents using the $set operator.

db.apple.update(
    { },
    { $set: { purchased_date: new Date() } },
    { multi: true }
)

#3

db.apple.drop()

#4

db.apple.find()

#5

db.apple.find(
    { quality: { $ne: "A" } }
)

#6
db.apple.find( { quality: "A" } ).sort( { user_id: 1 } )
