#Exercise 1

Everyone is tasked with making a website for our class. This site must be about Git and the benefits of using it. Everyone must collaborate on it. 

The process will consist of 4 seperate 5 minute stages. 
1. Everyone is working on creating the site separately.
2. Everyone will zip their files over to an elected person. This person will work on merging all the files into one. The remaining people will continue on improving the site. 
3. Rotate untill everyone has had a chance to merge.
