## Exercise 1

Visit: https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/concepts

In groups, research 7 of the 14 concepts presented there. You'll be expected to present the concept as well as an explanation of where the concepts fits in with the rest of concepts you've chosen.

You're not expected to be experts, but similar to the frameworks exercise, do you best to be as thorough as possible.

## Lab Activity

With today's lab time, you can finish working through the Angular module on Code School (but you did that already, right? ;).

After that, it's time for more practice!

Codeacademy also as Angular tutorial to work through:

- [Learn AngularJS](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-angularjs)

Once you've completed these tutorials, start thinking about how these concepts will apply to Project 4.
