## Pre-Work

Prior to class, watch this video for a primer on accessibility and why it's important:

- [Derek Featherstone: The Fine Art of Accessibility](https://vimeo.com/72175436)

Also, be sure to **bring headphones** to class today as we will be using screenreader software in class.

## Learning Objectives

- Define accessibility in a web-based context and why it's important.
- Describe various impairments that should be considered when building accessible websites and applications.
- Identify various assistive technologies and use them along with other accessibility evaluation tools to audit the accessibility of a website.
- Describe best practices around semantic mark-up to improve the accessibility of a website.
- Use the `tabindex` attribute to optimize the tab order for logical keyboard navigation of a website.
- Use ARIA attributes to augment the accessibility of an HTML element.
- Describe best practices when writing CSS to prevent styles and layout from hampering the accessibility of a website.

## Keywords

- Accessibility
- [Web Accessibility Initiative (W3C-WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)
- [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag)
- [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/)
- Assistive technology

## Exercise 1

The W3C-WAI provides an **[extensive reference guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/)** for satisfying WCAG 2.0 Guidelines (which serve as the foundation for much of the legislation mandating web accessibility).

WebAIM has also summarized these guidelines in a **[checklist](http://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist)**.

Working in small groups, you will be assigned one of the principles and put together a short presentation explaining the principle's related guidelines to the class.

Be creative with this! Feel free to use visuals, demos, or other teaching aids for your mini-lesson.

## Exercise 2

Let's to do some accessibility testing on our Aloha projects.

First follow the instructions to **[add the tota11y script](http://khan.github.io/tota11y/)** on your Aloha site. Also **[install the Accessibility Developer Tools extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb)** in Chrome. Run an audit with each tool...what kinds of accessibility issues can you identify?

After running your initial audits, try using **VoiceOver or ChromeVox** to experience you site as someone using a screen reader would. Do you notice any problematic points?

*Jot down a few notes from the above tests and be ready to share them with the class.*
