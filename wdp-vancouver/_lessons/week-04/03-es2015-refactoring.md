## Lab Activity

####Bring it all together!
After getting comfortable with some of the new features of ES2015, take the solution to Project 3 (Instagrid), and refactor it using Webpack, the Babel loader and JavaScript's new language features!


Use git to create and name a new branch in your project, so you don't overwrite your original solution!
