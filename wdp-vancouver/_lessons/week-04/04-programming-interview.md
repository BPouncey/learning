## Learning Objectives

In todays lesson, you'll be presented with typical programming challenges which you might encounter if you were applying for a job at a company like Facebook, Google, Amazon or Microsoft.

The challenges today will be very difficult, but will not employ any special JavaScript techniques you have not learned, and you'll have the entire day to complete the challenges.

You mission is to try to apply what you've learned, and attempt to come up with a solution to as many of the problems as you can.

You have the options to work as a group, or as part of more than one group to solve the challenges.

If you or your group comes up with a solution, we'll share it with the class, and discuss your implementation, as well as dicsuss other potential solutions!

#### Tips For Success

1. Take your time
2. Break down the problems into smallest possible steps
3. Think about what variables / vallues you'll need
4. Ask others for help if you're stuck!

## Challenge 1

Given a number that represents the position of the minute hand on a clock (number of minutes from 0 - 60) write a program that console.log's the angle that is formed by the minute hand and 12!

If the use enters a number that is above 60, you're program should fail, and log a friendly message to the console, informing the user of their error.

## Challenge 2

Given a list of stock prices for a number of days, your goal is to return the maximum profit that could have been made by buying a stock at one price and then selling the stock later on, (for the sale price on that day).

What does this mean? For example, if given a list of stock prices per day: [45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11], your program should return 16!

Why? For this particular list, if you had bought stock at 24 and sold it at 40, a profit of 16 was made. For this list, 16 is the largest profit you could have made buy buying and selling on specifi days. If no profit could have been made, your program should console.log "All is lost!".

Use this list to start:
`[47, 50, 22, 11, 15, 90, 88]`
