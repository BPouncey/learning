## Pre-Work

Please explore the [Webpack documentation](https://webpack.github.io/docs/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=documentation) page.

---

## Agenda

Today we'll briefly discuss developing ES2015 applications using the Webpack build tool.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Install the Webpack compiler as a Gulp task.
- Separate code into modules, and explain why this is important.
- Refactor a non-trivial application from ES5 to ES2015

---

## Lab Activity

We'll install Webpack in our 2nd project and spend our time in class today refactoring to use some of the new features of ES2015!

Use git to create and name a new branch in your project, so you don't overwrite your original solution!
