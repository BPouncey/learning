## Exercise 1

Write the appropriate command line commands for these written instructions:

- Create 2 folders, one named `Folder1` and one named `Folder2`, in your home directory
- Inside `Folder1` create 2 files with the extension `.txt`
- Copy the two files from `Folder1` into `Folder2`
- Delete one of the files in `Folder1`
- Delete `Folder2`
- Rename `Folder1` to `SuperFolder1`

When we're done, we'll do a group challenge to make sure we have an understanding of these commands.

## Lab Activity

Set up your computer for front-end development success!

We'll install and set up the following programs from the command line:

- Sass (a CSS Preprocessor)
- GULP (a JavaScript task runner)
- JSHint (a Javascript code quality checker)
- JSCS (a Javascript code style checker)

We'll also set up Git and GitHub for Project 3!
