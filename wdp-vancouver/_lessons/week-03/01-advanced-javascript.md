# Agenda

In today's class we'll evaluate your progress with learning JavaScript. Complete as many exercises as you can on the Free Code Camp JavaScript track here: [http://www.freecodecamp.com/map](http://www.freecodecamp.com/map).
Find the â€‰**Basic JavaScript (10 hours)** track.
You'll be expected to get at least half way through the exercises by the end of the class.
Remember to **use your classmates** as a resource when trying to solve difficult exercises.
