## Pre-Work

Be sure to [follow these directions to install Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install) before class.

Then visit the Sass homepage and take a look around!

- [Sass Homepage](http://sass-lang.com/guide)

### Challenge Yourself:

Visit this site and review the tutorial. The code and concepts should seem unfamiliar. As a challenge to yourself, see if you can determine what the code is doing, and describe it to yourself, in your own words. This is an advanced example, but it uses all of the features of SASS we'll be covering in this session:

## Learning Objectives

- Define what a CSS preprocessor is, and how it can speed up development.
- Structure SASS files according to best practices.
- Implement basic SASS techniques like nesting, variables, mixins, and operations.
- Apply SASS language skills to writing SASS for responsive websites.
- Install SASS locally and compile it into plain vanilla CSS.
- Create and use source maps to assist with SASS debugging.
- Distinguish between different CSS preprocessor such as SASS, SCSS, and LESS.

## Exercise 1

In this exercise, we'll refactor some CSS into Sass, using the basic functionality we've learned.

You can [download the exercise file here](/public/files/exercises/sass-e1.zip).

Take a look at the code in the `.scss` file, and refactor it into actual Sass by doing the following:

- Nest selectors where appropriate (but be careful not to over-nest them!)
- Abstract repeated styles (colours, spacing units, etc.) into variables (hint: make these go at the top of the stylesheet)
- Create a mixin to take care of auto-prefixing where required
- Use a math operation to adjust the size of the base spacing unit on elements where applicable

Last but not least, you'll need to **compile** your Sass into CSS so your browser can read it.

We'll discuss the results by examining the SCSS as well as the compiled CSS.

## Exercise 2

In this exercise we'll create media query helpers using SASS mixins and the `@content` directive, for common breakpoints.

We'll then discuss, how this techniques saves time when developing responsive websites.

---

## Lab Activity

Weâ€™ll implement the following SASS enhancements in your web projects:

- Media query helpers.
- Basic themeability, using SASS variables.
- SASS compilation using Gulp.
- SASS Source-maps for debugging your stylesheets.
