## Pre-Work

Visit the SASS homepage and take a look around!

- [SASS Homepage](http://sass-lang.com/guide)


### Challenge Yourself:

Visit this site and review the tutorial. The code and concepts should seem unfamiliar. As a challenge to yourself, see if you can determine what the code is doing, and describe it to yourself, in your own words. This is an advanced example, but it uses all of the features of SASS we'll be covering in this session:

- Implement basic SASS techniques like nesting, variables, mixins, and operations.
- Apply SASS language skills to writing SASS for responsive websites.
- Install SASS locally and compile it into plain vanilla CSS.
- Create and use source maps to assist with SASS debugging.
- Distinguish between different CSS preprocessor such as SASS, SCSS, and LESS.

## Exercise 1	

In this exercise, we'll refactor some CSS into SCSS, using the basic functionality we've learned.
We'll then discuss the results by examining the SCSS as well as the compiled CSS. 

---

## Exercise 2

In this exercise we'll create media query helpers using SASS mixins and the `@content` directive, for common breakpoints.
We'll then discuss, how this techniques saves time when developing responsive websites. 

---

## Lab Activity

Weâ€™ll implement the following SASS enhancements in your web projects:

- Media query helpers.
- Basic themeability, using SASS variables.
- SASS compilation using Gulp.
- SASS Source-maps for debugging your stylesheets.
