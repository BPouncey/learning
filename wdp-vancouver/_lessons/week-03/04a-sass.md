## Learning Objectives

- Define what a CSS preprocessor is, and how it can speed up development.
- Structure Sass files according to best practices.
- Implement basic Sass techniques like nesting, variables, mixins, and operations.
- Apply Sass language skills to writing Sass for responsive websites.
- Install Sass locally and compile it into plain vanilla CSS.
- Create and use source maps to assist with Sass debugging.
- Distinguish between different CSS preprocessors such as Sass, SCSS, and Less.

## Exercise 1

In this exercise, we'll refactor some CSS into Sass, using the basic functionality we've learned.

You can [download the exercise file here](/public/files/exercises/sass-e1.zip).

Take a look at the code in the `.scss` file, and refactor it into actual Sass by doing the following:

- Nest selectors where appropriate (but be careful not to over-nest them!)
- Abstract repeated styles (colours, spacing units, etc.) into variables (hint: make these go at the top of the stylesheet)
- Create a mixin to take care of auto-prefixing where required
- Use a math operation to adjust the size of the base spacing unit on elements where applicable

Last but not least, you'll need to **compile** your Sass into CSS so your browser can read it.

We'll discuss the results by examining the SCSS as well as the compiled CSS.

## Exercise 2

In this exercise we'll create media query helpers using Sass mixins and the `@content` directive, for common breakpoints.

We'll then discuss, how this techniques saves time when developing responsive websites.

---

## Lab Activity

This afternoon, weâ€™ll implement the following Sass enhancements in your Project 2 websites:

- Media query helpers
- Basic theme-ability, using Sass variables
- Separating your styles into Sass partials
- Sass compilation, minification, and auto-prefixing using Gulp
