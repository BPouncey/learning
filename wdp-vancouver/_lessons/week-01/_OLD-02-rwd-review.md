## Pre-Work

This article by Ethan Marcotte on A List Apart, which is widely credited with kicking off the responsive web design movement:

- [Responsive Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/)

The four sections of this guide are essential RWD pre-reading:

- [Responsive Web Design Basics](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/layouts/rwd-fundamentals/?hl=en)

## Learning Objectives

- Define "responsive web design" and its three components.
- Distinguish between fixed, fluid, adaptive, responsive, and mobile-only websites.
- Convert a fixed-width, desktop-sized website to be responsive (optimized for multiple breakpoints) using a mobile-first approach.

## Exercise 1

Your task is to find an example of a responsively-designed website. Take notes on:

- Where are the main breakpoints? What happens at these breakpoints?
- What happens to the navigation for mobile widths?
- Are there ads on the site? How are they handled?
- Does anything seem to be not-quite-right at any width?

Afterward, we'll pair up and share our findings.

## Exercise 2

Let's try converting a desktop-only website to be fully responsive and mobile-first.

You'll be optimizing for two breakpoints: `480px` and `720px`

Screenshots of what the website should look like at mobile, tablet, and desktop width have been included in the following package:

## Exercise 3

Now that we've had a chance to brush up our RWD skills, let's strategize how we'll apply this to our Week 1 projects.

Take a few moments to review the two new design comps and think about what areas of the site will specifically be affected by the changes that are happening at each breakpoint.

Jot some idea out on your own, then you'll team up to discuss with a partner. We'll then reconvene to discuss each other strategies, as well as any questions or concerns before starting with the lab work.

## Lab Activity

We'll continue to work on our Week 1 Project in today's lab.

You goal for today is to refactor your CSS into mobile-first media queries based on the provided design comps.
