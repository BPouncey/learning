## Pre-Work

Complete the following Codeacademy course prior to class:

- [Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)

**Mac users:** Please ensure you have Terminal installed on your computer (this app comes pre-installed on every Mac, but make sure you verify that it's there).

**Windows users:** Please install **[Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)** before class so you can run Linux-style commands on your Windows machine during the lesson.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjxEH_tr7e0) will run-through the Cygwin installation process (you **do not** need to install any additional packages during the installation process).

## Exercise 1

Time to roll up your sleeves and try out some commands!

You're going to do the following using the CLI only:

1. Try out the the `pwd` and `ls` commands
2. Navigate to your Desktop and create a directory called `my_site`
3. Rename the `my_site` directory `website`
4. Create an `index.html` file inside of your new directory (using the CLI!)
5. Create an `assets` sub-directory in there too
6. Add a `style.css` file to `assets`
7. Delete the `assets` folder and its contents
8. Delete the `index.html` in the root of your `website` directory
9. Delete the `website` directory
