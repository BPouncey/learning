## Web Fonts: Exercise 1

Go to **Font Squirrel** and download the Webfont Kit for the custom typefaces that we'll be using for Project 1: **[Playfair Display](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/playfair-display)** (Regular and Bold) and **[Raleway](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/raleway)** (Light and Medium).

You'll need to download both of the weights and their italic versions too for each typeface. Add the contents of your generated web font packages to your project.

Youâ€™ll also want to read up on how to **[avoid faux italics and bolding](http://www.metaltoad.com/blog/how-use-font-face-avoid-faux-italic-and-bold-browser-styles)** with your `@font-face` typefaces, and adjust your CSS accordingly.

## Web Fonts: Exercise 2

We're going to use Font Awesome to add the social media icons in the footer of the Project 1 website.

Download Font Awesome and add the font files and minified CSS file to your project (unless you choose to link to the CDN resource).

Be sure to hook up the stylesheet in the `<head>` of your website too!

To add the social media icons, check out Font Awesome's [Brand Icons](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/#brand).

## Lab Activity

We'll continue to work on Project 1 in today's lab.

This is the homestretch! You now have all the HTML/CSS knowledge you'll need to finish building out Project 1. Wherever you hit a stumbling block, be sure to ask Google, check Stack Overflow, or ask a classmate.
