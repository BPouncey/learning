## Exercise 2

Let's add a CSS file to your Project 1 webpage now.

To do that, create a `style.css` file in the root folder of your website.

Next, just like in the last example, add a <link> tag to the <head> of your HTML file so it knows to apply the styles that we add to this file later on to your page.

## Exercise 3

Classes and IDs...

# Exercise 4

Position and floats...

---

# Exercise 5

Color and backgrounds...

## Lab Activity

Today's lab time will be dedicated to the Week 1 Project.

By the end of the second day you'll should have a enough CSS written to begin approximating the general layout of the website.
