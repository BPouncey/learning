## Exercise 1

Your turn! Time to create your first webpage.

First things first...you need to pick a code editor to download and install it (if you haven't done so already).

Next create a root folder somewhere on our computer and save a new file called `index.html`.

Then open that folder and create a simple webpage containing `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>` tags, then add a few paragraphs of text.

Lastly, save and view your new website in a browser.

## Exercise 2

Let's explore what these HTML5 elements are good for.

In teams of two, research your assigned element and report back to the class:

- What the semantically appropriate usage of the element is
- Any potential sources of confusion about this element's usage
- Where you think this element may be used in this week's project (if at all)

---

## Exercise 3

Let's dive right in and start thinking about how we might tackle the first project's design comp to convert it into semantically-appropriate HTML elements.

Jot some idea out on your own, then you'll team up to discuss your approach with a partner. Based on this discussion, is there anything you'd revise in your approach?

Finally, you and your partner will share your insights with the class.

## Lab Activity

Today's lab time will be dedicated to the Project 1.

You're goal for the end of the first day is to have the different sections of the website roughed-out in HTML.
