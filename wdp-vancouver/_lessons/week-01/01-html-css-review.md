## Pre-Work

Prior to the first day of class, you should be reasonably comfortable with all of the content in this online book:

- [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)

---

## Learning Objectives

- Write well-structured HTML, properly nesting elements and applying appropriate attributes.
- Use the HTML5 doctype and elements to semantically structure a web page.
- Demonstrate competency with CSS layout principles and box model properties.
- Adjust the default appearance of HTML elements using a variety of selectors, including classes, IDs, pseudo-elements, and pseudo-classes.
- Use browser developer tools to assist with development debugging.
- Interpret a design comp and build it out as HTML and CSS.

## Keywords

- CSS3
- CSS reset
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Browser developer tools

## Part 1 / Exercise 1

Let's dive right in and start thinking about how we might tackle the first project's design comp to convert it into semantic HTML elements.

Jot some idea out on your own, then you'll team up to discuss your approach with a partner. Based on this discussion, is there anything you'd revise in your approach?

Finally, you and your partner will share your insights with the class.

---

## Part 1 / Exercise 2

Let's explore what these HTML5 elements are good for.

In teams of two, research your assigned element and report back to the class:

- What the semantically appropriate usage of the element is
- Any potential sources of confusions about this element's usage
- Where you think this element may be used in the project (if at all)

---

## Part 1 / Exercise 3

Let's get our first projects set up and ready to go!

Your tasks:

- Create your project directory
- Create an `index.html` file
- Add all of the essential HTML elements we discussed
- Initialize a Git repository in its root, and push it to GitHub

---

## Part 2 / Exercise 1

In groups you'll design a poster, code demo, etc. that would be suitable for explaining your assigned topic to someone who knows nothing about them:

- **Block** vs. **Inline** vs. **Inline-block elements**
- **Floats** vs. **Positioning**
- **Pseudo-elements** vs. **Pseudo-classes**
- **Box model properties** and its **shorthand** tricks
- Three methods for **clearing floats**

## Part 2 / Exercise 2

Use this Codepen to build out the login form depicted on the following slide:

<iframe height='268' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/redacademy/embed/VLoqVR/?height=268&theme-id=0&default-tab=css' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/redacademy/pen/VLoqVR/'>VLoqVR</a> by RED Academy (<a href='http://codepen.io/redacademy'>@redacademy</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

---

## Part 2 / Exercise 3

Time to put your own project under the microscope!

Try running your project's HTML through the W3C validator. Are there any errors or warnings? How can you address them?

You're also encourages to take some of the other tools (performance testers, etc.) for spin on other projects you've previously completed.

---

## Lab Activity

Today's lab time will be dedicated to the Week 1 Project.

You're goal for the end of the first day is to have the different sections of the website roughed-out in HTML.

By the end of the second day you'll should have a enough CSS written to begin approximating the general layout of the website.
