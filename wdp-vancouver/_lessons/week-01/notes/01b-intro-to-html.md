## Intro to HTML

Brain Dump:

Break into groups, and write every word you know associated w/ HTML.
We'll read them out, cancel each other out, and chat about things as we go.

The goal here is to see where the class is at in terms of general knowledge.

Debrief:
- Make sure Inline and Block elements are covered
- Make sure key elements are covered: Links, images, lists, semantic elements
- HTML Versions
- Meta tags `<meta charset="utf-8">`
- Make sure we cover attributes

Question:

Who here brought a notebook?

Debrief:
- Why bring something analog into a digital school?

Activity:

Think/Pair/Shate: what is 'Syntax'?

Debrief:

- Is syntax the best way to communicate human ideas?
- Is syntax the best way to communicate computer instructions?
- Since neither of the above are true, what is Syntax?

Game:

Let's play "You know more about my family tree than I do"

Start with my great grandparent, let students pick the # of children and their names. Draw the family tree until they get to my generation.

Debrief:
- Hierarchy
- Ancestors, Descendants, Parents, Children, Siblings
- Tree, Root, Branch, Leaf

Activity:

Draw your About Me prework page as a tree.

Debrief:

- Discuss why it might be useful to create models before we write code
- Talk about the universality of trees, ie filesystem

Activity:

Pick someone's tree, get them to help render it using the following rules:

- Everything is a box
- Parent elements contain child elements by nesting them within
- Traverse the tree depth first, pre-order
- Block Elements take up the full width of their container
- Inline Elements are arranged side by side

Activity:

Open developer tools for the page we just turned into a tree and rendered. Show them how to access the DOM tree, and show them how hovering elements highlights the boxes we drew in the previous exercise.

Debrief:
- Default styles
- Dev Tools Shortcut (add to shortcuts.txt)
- Dev tools orientation

Lab Activity:

View the design comp for P1.
Draw it as a tree, then convert that tree to HTML.
