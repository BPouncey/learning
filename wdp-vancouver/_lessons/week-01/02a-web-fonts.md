## Exercise 1

Go to **Transfonter** and download the Webfont Kit for the custom typefaces that we'll be using for Project 1: **[Playfair Display](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/playfair-display)** (Regular and Bold) and **[Raleway](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/raleway)** (Light and Medium).

You'll need to download both of the weights and their italic versions too for each typeface. Add the contents of your generated web font packages to your project.

---

## Exercise 2

We're going to use Font Awesome to add the social media icons in the footer of the Project 1 website.

Download Font Awesome and add the font files and minified CSS file to your project, or load it from the Font Awesome CDN using a generated embed code instead.

To add the social media icons, check out Font Awesome's [Brand Icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=brands).
