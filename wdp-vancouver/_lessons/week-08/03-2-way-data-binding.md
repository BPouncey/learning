Create and style a voter registration form!
Using what you know about Angular and CSS, create a form with the following fields:

- First name (max-length 140)
- Last name (max-length 140)
- Age (must be number)
- Gender (radio buttons)
- House # (must be number)
- Street address
- Province (select menu)
- Accept voter responsibility (checkbox)

All of the fields are required, and the form should indicate to the user if they try to submit the form with empty fields.
