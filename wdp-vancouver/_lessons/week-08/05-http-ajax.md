## Pre-Work

Review the angular documentation for $http:

## Learning Objectives

Today we'll use Angular's `$http` service to fetch and save real data in our application!
We'll also explore Angular's **Service** and **Factory** modules and use them to create an API *service* we can use in our newly created view controllers. The application will use a custom API created by RED specifically for this project.
