## Pre-Work

A good read to brush up your JS skills before class:

- [JavaScript for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/)

## Learning Objectives

- Define basic programming concepts such as statements, booleans, conditionals, loops, and variables (in relation to JavaScript).
- Distinguish how JavaScript differs from other "server-side" programming languages.
- Use the browserâ€™s developer tools to debug JavaScript errors.

## Exercise 1

Open a new browser tab and open the console, and type in each line one at a time:

```js
alert('Hello World!');
prompt('What\'s your name?');
document.write('<h1>Hi There!</h1>');
```

If we wanted to store the value inputted into the `prompt` and print it out in an `alert` afterward, how might we do that?

And what would we do if wanted to output the value that was entered in the `prompt` with the string `Hello, ` in front of it in the subsequent `alert`?

## Exercise 2

## Exercise 3

Let's add an external JS file to our Project 2 directory, and include it in our `index.html` file for the project.

To make sure you've done it correctly, `console.log()` any string in the JS file, and make sure that it shows up in the console when you open the HTML file in your browser window.

We won't be adding any other JS to this file today, but will be later in the week when we learn about jQuery.

## Lab Activity

Today's lab time will be dedicated to Project 2.

Your task today is to begin roughing out your project in HTML and CSS based on the provided design comps. We'll have more time to work on this tomorrow, and we'll start adding interactive components on Wednesday.
