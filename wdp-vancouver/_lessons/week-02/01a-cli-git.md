## Pre-Work

### Tutorials

Complete the following Udacity bash shell tutorial:

- [Shell Workshop](https://www.udacity.com/course/shell-workshop--ud206)

Also complete the following Code School Git tutorial before class:

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/)

### Software Installation

You'll also need to install an appropriate **CLI app** and **Git**.

**Mac users:**

We will be using iTerm2, which is a much better app than the default Terminal app.

- [Download iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html) (Make sure you download the _stable_ version)

We will be using Homebrew to install command-line tools. If you're feeling adventurous, you can install it before class.

- [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

**Windows users:**

Install Git:

1. [Download Git for Windows.](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Double-click the `.exe` file you just downloaded to install Git on your system.

The installation process will also install Git BASH on your computer, which you can use to run most of the commands in the lesson.

Install Node.js:

- [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/)
