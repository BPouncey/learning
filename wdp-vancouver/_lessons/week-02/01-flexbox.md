## Lab Activity

Today's lab time is all about getting comfortable with flexbox...

First, code along with the videos in the **[What the Flexbox?!](http://flexbox.io/#/)** series.

Once you finish those, take what you've learned about flexbox and apply it to solving the 24 challenges in **[Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)**.

Finally, spend any remaining time today removing all of the floats and replacing them with flexbox properties to achieve the same layout in Project 1.
