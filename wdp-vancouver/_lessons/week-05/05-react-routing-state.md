## Pre-Work

Check out the React Router github project [here!](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router)

---

## Learning Objectives

Today we'll discuss URL routing in single-page applications, and we'll create a typical SPA in React, buy completing a new mini-project.

We'll also introduce the final project for React week!

---

# Exercise 1

Let's use React Router to load JavaScript dynamically.
Once we've set everything up, we'll observe how our JavaScript downloads as we navigate our demo application in Chrome's developer tools.

## Lab Activity

We're going to build a functional email inbox that uses the **react-router** project to help us display components associated with a URL.

#### Mini-Project Stretch Goals
- Add the ability to undo the 'Trashing of an item'.
- Add the ability to 'put back' an item from the trash/archive to the inbox.
- Add the ability to filter: Show only completed todos; show only incomplete todos
