## Pre-Work

Complete the following readings on ES2015 classes before class:

- [An Introduction to ES6 Classes](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/an-introduction-to-javascript-es6-classes/)
- [Learn ES2015: Classes](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/#classes)

We'll be using HTML Canvas to build the Pong game in Project 3, so you'll want to work through this tutorial before class:

- [HTML5 Canvas Tutorial: An Introduction](https://www.sitepoint.com/html5-canvas-tutorial-introduction/)

## Learning Objectives

- Explain what object-oriented programming is in the JavaScript context.
- Describe and instantiate objects using the new `class` syntax.
- Describe and use the elements of a `class`, including the `constructor` and 'methods'.
- Describe how `this` functions within classes.
- Describe and use `extends` and `super` for inheritance purposes.
- `import` and `export` ES2015 classes as modules (as `default` or named exports).

## Exercise 1

Imagine you want to create an **object-oriented model of a soccer game**&mdash;what kind of class "blueprints" would you need to create to represent all of the elements of the game as objects (e.g. a player, the ball, etc.)?

What kinds of **properties** (i.e. adjectives/traits) would be needed to describe each object, and what kinds of **methods** (i.e. verbs/actions) would be available to each object?

Work in groups to create a **poster-based representation** your object-oriented soccer game, and present your work to the class.

---

## Exercise 2

Pick one of the classes your group modeled in the previous soccer game exercise, and use that to **write your first ES2015 class**.

Ensure that you set all the appropriate **properties** in the `constructor` and create all the required **methods** for your class.

---

## Exercise 3

Now model our own classroom using the following classes. Note that `WebDevStudent` should be a subclass of `Student` and `Student` should be a subclass of `Person`. Create at least **three properties** and **one method** on each class.

- Clazz *
- Person
- Student
- WebDevStudent

*(note: class is a keyword in JavaScript, and thus cannot be a valid name)*<br />

*Instantiate your classmates using* `new WebDevStudent()`.

## Lab Activity

In today's lab, you'll commence work on Project 3 using what you've now learned about ES2015 syntactical features and Webpack to build a Pong game.
