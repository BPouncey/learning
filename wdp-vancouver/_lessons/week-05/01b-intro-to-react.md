## Learning Objectives

- Demonstrate uses of the JavaScript Array Methods `.map()` and `.filter()`
- Review scope of `this` and the `.bind()` method

## Exercise 1

- Create an Array of 5 Todo objects. The objects should have a `name` and `completed` property.
- Set some of the Todos completed property to `true` and others to `false`.
- Use the `.filter()` method to search for and eliminate all item with a completed status set to true.
- Use the `.map()` method to change all of the Todos to completed.

## Exercise 2

We'll create our first React Component, and demonstrate how component state and the component's
render method work together to update the component's UI.

---

## Lab Activity

In today's lab we'll start coding our first React mini-project. **A Snazzy todo list!**

#### Mini-Project Stretch Goals
- Add the ability to change the name of a todo, once it's need added.
- Add the ability to filter: Show only completed todos; show only incomplete todos
