## Learning Objectives

- Demonstrate uses of the Javascript Array Methods `.map()` and `.filter()`
- Review scope of `this` and the `.bind()` method
- Explain `components` and `props` & `state`
- Use `props` & `state` to update a React component's UI.

---

---

## Exercise 2

Search for and eliminate elements from an existing array using the `.filter()` method:
Use the example from [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)

---

## Exercise 3
Let's come to grips with the `.bind()` method: Use the examples from [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind)

---

## Exercise 4
Let's review the `switch` statement and it's specifically syntax: Use the examples from [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch)

---

## Exercise 5

We'll create our first React Component, and demonstrate how component state and the component's
render method work together to update the components UI.

---

## Lab Activity

In today's lab we'll start coding our first React mini-project. **A Snazzy todo list!**

#### Mini-Project Stretch Goals
- Add the ability to change the name of a todo, once it's need added.
- Add the ability to filter: Show only completed todos; show only incomplete todos
