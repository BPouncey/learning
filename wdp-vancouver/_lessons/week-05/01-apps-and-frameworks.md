## Exercise 1

Visit each of the frameworks mentioned in the previous slide.

Browse through the documentation and try to discover the tools that are provided for creating **models**, **views** and **controllers**, and how they are meant to be used together.

You're not expected to produce in depth technical details, just describe things as you see them in your own words and try to be as thorough as possible.

## Lab Activity

During today's lab activity, you'll spend your time familiarizing yourself with some basic Angular concepts to prepare for tomorrow's class.

First up, watch this video:

- [AngularJS Fundamentals In 60-ish Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9MHigUZKEM)

Be sure to watch it right to the end, because it offers a very coherent explanation of the concepts we'll be covering over the next week.

Second, start working the following free tutorial on Code School:

- [Shaping up with Angular.js](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js)
