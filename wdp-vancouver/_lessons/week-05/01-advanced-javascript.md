## Agenda

We'll take a close look at the quirks and unusual bits of the **ES5 JavaScript specification**.

We'll discuss some puzzling and irritating language features, and how to avoid the common pitfalls associated with them when programming in JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe the circumstances where JavaScript will explicitly change the canonical type of a value.
- Describe the behaviour of the loose (`==`) versus strict (`===`) comparison operators.
- Explain how function scope works in JavaScript
- Define the purpose of an immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE).
- Describe the behaviour of function expressions versus function declarations written inside conditional blocks.
- Describe what is meant by the difference between "passing by value" and "passing by reference".
- Explain why JavaScript provides a `bind` method.
- Describe ways to influence the value of `this` when extracting methods from objects.

## Lab Activity

Choose your Own Adventure

In pairs, you're going to write a Choose Your Own Adventure story. It will need:

- At least 3 yes or no questions using logical operators
- At least 1 mulitple choice question
- At least 1 loop - something needs to repeat in order to complete

The lab task is to:

1. Design your story as a __decision tree__.
1. Sketch out the story in pseudocode
1. Implement the story using JS

# Practice Makes Perfect

Practice what you've learned by continuing on with [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/ma).

Find the **Basic JavaScript (10 hours)** section, and complete as many of these exercises as you can today.

Remember to use your instructors and your fellow students as a resource if you're stuck.

NOTE: There is a string lesson about `\n` and `\r` with a bug. If you hit it, skip it!

**Good luck!**
