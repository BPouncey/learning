## Learning Objectives

Today we'll use Angular's `$http` service to fetch and save real data in our application! We'll also explore Angular's **Service**, **Factory** and **Provider** modules and use them to create an API service we can use in our newly created view controllers. The application will use a custom API created by RED specifically for this project. You can explore the API documentation here: (url pending)
