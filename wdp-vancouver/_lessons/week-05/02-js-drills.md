Choose your Own Adventure

In pairs, you're going to write a Choose Your Own Adventure story. It will need:

- At least 3 yes or no questions using logical operators
- At least 1 mulitple choice question
- At least 1 loop - something needs to repeat in order to complete

The lab task is to:

1. Sketch out the story in pseudocode
1. Implement the story using JS

# Practice Makes Perfect

Practice what you've learned by continuing on with [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/ma).

Find the **Basic JavaScript (10 hours)** section, and complete as many of these exercises as you can today.

Remember to use your instructors and your fellow students as a resource if you're stuck.

NOTE: There is a string lesson about `\n` and `\r` with a bug. If you hit it, skip it!

**Good luck!**
