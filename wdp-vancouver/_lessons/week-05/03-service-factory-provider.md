## Lab Activity

In today's lab we'll continue working on Project 4 and complete this exercise:

### JS Exercise

#### Looping a Triangle

Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

```html
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```

It will be useful to remember that you can find the  length of a string by writing `.length` after it.

```js
var abc = "abc";
console.log(abc.length);
// â†’ 3
```

**Hints:**

You can start with a program that simply prints out the numbers 1 to 7, which you can derive by making a few modifications to the even number printing example given earlier in the chapter, where the `for` loop was introduced.

Now consider the equivalence between numbers and strings of hash characters. You can go from 1 to 2 by adding 1 (`+= 1`). You can go from "#" to "##" by adding a character (`+= "#"`). Thus, your solution can closely follow the number-printing program.
