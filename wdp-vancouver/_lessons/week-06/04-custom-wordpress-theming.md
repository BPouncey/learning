## Pre-Work

Prior to jumping into theming class, you'll want to make sure you've wrapped your head around some important Wordpress jargon:

- [WordPress Semantics](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Semantics)

*Explore the links within that Codex entry for further clarification where needed!*

Let's explore the `redstarter` theme together...

You can [download a copy here](https://github.com/redacademy/redstarter/archive/master.zip) and add it to your `wp-content/themes` directory to follow along.

## Lab Activity

In today's lab, we're going to dive into Project 5 and use what we learned about custom WordPress theming to begin building out Le Red Bread's website.

Copy the starter theme into the WP installation on your computer where you are going to build out your project, and **rename** the folder something a bit more descriptive (e.g. `leredbread`).

Next, to get your project set-up, you'll want to:

- Run `npm install` in the root of the theme directory so you can get Gulp up and running
