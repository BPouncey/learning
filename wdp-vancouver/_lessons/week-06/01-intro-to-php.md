## Exercise 1

Time to try out some PHP:

- Create an `index.php` file in your `htdocs` directory (or `www` dir if using WAMP)
- In that file write `<?php  ?>` so Apache knows it needs to parse it
- Between your opening and closing PHP tags write `echo "Hello world!";`
- Go to http://localhost:8888 and check it out

---

## Exercise 2

Get ready for your second round of FizzBuzz...PHP-style!

You'll complete this exercise inside of your `index.php` file.

For numbers divisible by 3, `echo` **Fizz** instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), `echo` **Buzz** instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to `echo` **FizzBuzz**, for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still `echo` **Fizz** or **Buzz** for numbers divisible by only one of those).

## Additional Resources

PHP is a well-documented language and you can find its docs here:

- [Documentation](http://php.net/docs.php)

This online book is a bit dated, but the following chapter is still relevant and very explanatory:

- [Hacking with PHP - How PHP is Written](http://www.hackingwithphp.com/2/6/0/how-php-is-written)
