## Pre-Work

Create a folder called *intro-to-angular* in your project directory.
Inside create 2 scratch files, one `index.html` and one `script.js`, and link the javascript file to the html file. 
We'll use this simple document to experiment with the code in this lesson.

## Learning Objectives

- Define what AngularJS is, and what role it plays in facilitating JS web app development.
- Define (at a high-level) a variety of essential Angular-related concepts.

## Exercise 1

Spend your time familiarizing yourself with some basic Angular concepts to prepare for this weeks assignments.

First up, watch this video:

- [AngularJS Fundamentals In 60-ish Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9MHigUZKEM)

Be sure to watch it right to the end, because it offers a very coherent explanation of the concepts we'll be covering over the next week.

Second, start working the following free tutorial on Code School:

- [Shaping up with Angular.js](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js)

---

## Lab Activity

Finish working through the Angular module on Code School (but you did that already, right? ;).

After that, it's time for more practice!

Codeacademy also as Angular tutorial to work through:

- [Learn AngularJS](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-angularjs)

Once you've completed these tutorials, start thinking about how these concepts will apply to Project 5.
