## Exercise 1

Let's build a widget together!

To do this, you'll need to download and unzip a copy of the **[RED Widget Boilerplate](https://github.com/redacademy/red-widget-boilerplate/archive/master.zip)**.

Once you've downloaded and unzipped it, move the directory to `wp-content/plugins/` and rename both the directory and the main plugin file `business-hours-widget`.

The rest of the exercise will be a code-along...

---

## Lab Activity

Today's lab time will be spent working on Project 5. Tie up the loose ends for on your custom business hours widget, and keep plugging away at the rest of the project!
