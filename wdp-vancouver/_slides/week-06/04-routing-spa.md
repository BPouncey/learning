# Agenda

Today we'll finish adding routes to our application and begin to add animations on page transitions using `ng-view` and  CSS `@keyframes`!
Animations will be achieved via SCSS and Angular's ngAnimate module, which we'll install in our application.
(We will not be covering JavaScript based animations).
