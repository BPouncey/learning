# What is Webpack?

Webpack is a JavaScript **module bundler**.

It's an open-source project released by Facebook.

Before we begin to use Webpack, we need to put it in context. To understand why it was created, how it compares to Gulp and other build tools, read the [Getting Started](https://webpack.github.io/docs/motivation.html) section of the Webpack documentation.

# What is Webpack?

Now that we have some context for what Webpack is and what it does vs. other tools, follow the [Getting Started](http://webpack.github.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/)
tutorial. Once completed we should be able to explain the following terms:

- Module loader
- Module bundler

How does Webpack treat CSS files? How is this different from the more traditional inclusion techniques we've seen so far in the course?
