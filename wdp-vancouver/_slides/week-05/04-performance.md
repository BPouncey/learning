# What is Performance?

---
class: center, middle

.large[
   What do you think **performance** means in the context of a website?
]

---

# Why It Matters

- Brand implications
- Mobile users
- SEO and A11Y implications

---
class: center, middle

### Performance is (mostly) on you!

Load time is typically 20% dependent on back-end activities (...so the DNS look-up, connecting to the server, SSL negotiation, and then content retrieval).

The other 80% is dependent on what happens in the front-end **after the HTML document has arrived** in the browser.

---

# What Makes a Website Appear Performant?

- **Page speed** (how fast does your page and its related resources load?)
- **Perceived performance** (often more important than the actual page speed!)

---
class: center, middle

### Perceived Performance?

Perceived performance is how fast a user *thinks* a site loads.

---

# Response Times

According to [Jakob Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/):

- **0.1 second** is about the limit for having the user feel that the system is reacting instantaneously.
- **1.0 second** is about the limit for the user's flow to stay uninterrupted, even though the user will notice the delay.
- **10 seconds** is about the limit for keeping the user's attention focused. Commence tab switching...

*This from a book published in 1993&mdash;it's likely that people's maximum attention spans are shorter than 10 seconds today!*

---

# Critical Rendering Path

Optimizing the **critical rendering path** pertains to prioritizing the display of content that relates to the current user action:

.footnote[Image credit: [Google](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/?hl=en)]

---

# How a Page Loads

1. The browser **fetches the HTML document** from the server and constructs the DOM
2. As the browser reads the HTML it retrieves the linked stylesheets&mdash;the browser **pauses everything to fetch the stylesheets** and then constructs the CSSOM
3. The browser uses the DOM and CSSOM create the **render tree** (computes the size and position of all visible elements)
4. The browser **paints** the final render tree and renders the pixels on the screen

---

# Optimizing CRP

To optimize the critical rendering path we must ensure that **primary actions are ready as soon as possible**, but this will require some planning:

- Prioritize "above the fold" requests
- Follow best practices for loading CSS and JS assets
- Cache assets for returning users
- Optimize images and other assets

*More on this to come...*

# Jank

**Jank** is stuttering or skipping as you scroll down the page.

It happens when the browser's rendering slows **below 60fps**.

**Cause of jankiness:** Changing visual properties or the visibility of elements trigger a **repaint** and/or **reflow** in the browser&mdash;these are expensive operations!

Jank is ultimately the result of the browser taking too long to make the frames (due to inefficient animations, too many repaints, etc.).

# Page Speed

class: center, middle

.large[
   What do we mean by<br />**page speed**?
]

---

# Loading Pages Faster

Improving the loading speed of a page boils down to two (seemingly) simple tasks:

- Reducing the number of requested resources and optimizing how they are loaded
- Reducing file sizes (of files containing code, images, etc.)

---

# Other Factors that Impact Page Speed

- Geography (but CDNs can help)
- Network (mobile, rural areas, etc.)
- Browsers ([What browsers are people using?](https://www.stetic.com/market-share/browser/))

---

# Testing Page Speed

Some options for testing page speed:

- [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
- [WebPageTest](http://www.webpagetest.org/)
- Your Chrome dev tools! (use the Network and Performance tabs)

---

# Testing Page Speed

Testing page speed with Chrome dev tools ðŸ¤”

We can also test a websites performance with built built-in developer tools.

In the Chrome DevTools, there is a tab labelled **Audits** where you can run test.
It's using a Google product called **Lighthouse** to perform the tests.

More about lighthouse audits: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/


---

# Testing Page Speed

With Chrome's DevTools we can also test for issues with the **Performance** and **Network** tabs.

![Chrome dev tools tabs](/public/img/slide-assets/performance/devtools-tabs.png)

---

### Network Tab

Press **command r** to reload the page and run the test.

.inline-images[
   ![Chrome dev tools network tab](/public/img/slide-assets/performance/aloha-network-tab.png)
]

---

### Performance Tab

When you open the performance tab there will be no initial tests, so you will have to click the refresh button to run a test.

.inline-images[
   ![Chrome dev tools performance tab](/public/img/slide-assets/performance/aloha-performance-tab-1.png)
]

---

### Performance Tab

After the page reloads and the test is run your DevTools will look something like this:

   ![Chrome dev tools performance tab](/public/img/slide-assets/performance/aloha-performance-tab-2.png)
]

---

# Exercise 1

Go to one of your favourite websites and do the following:

- Use the Network tab in your dev tools to determine how many requests are made, its page weight, how long it takes to load, and whether its CRP appears to be optimized.
- Use the Performance tab in your dev tools to record and identify possible issues.
- Run the website URL through Google PageSpeed Insights and see what recommendations for desktop and mobile.

Be prepared to share your insights with the class!

# Optimizing Images

---
class: center, middle

### Impact of Images

Images account for **most of page weight**, <br />so big performance gains can be made easily here!

---

# How to Optimize Images

- Use SVGs (can be embedded directly in HTML)
- Use icon fonts (customize with only the icons you need)
- Use CSS3 properties where you can
- "Save for Web/Devices" using Photoshop, Gimp, or [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)
- Compress/minify your images with [imagemin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-imagemin), [Compressor.io](https://compressor.io/compress) in your build tooling, the web app [Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/) or the [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) app
- Choose the right image format for the job...

---
class: center, middle

Format | Best For
-------|---------------------------------
JPEG   | Photos, images with many colours
GIF    | Animations, simple graphics
PNG-24 | Partial transparency
SVG    | Graphics that need to scale

---

# Image Optimization Checklist

1. Have I picked the right image format?
2. Have I run all of my images through a compression tool?
3. Can I (reasonably) use CSS or an SVG for this?

**Note:** Image optimization isn't something you only do before you launch a website...there needs to be a long-term strategy in place for site editors!

---

# Exercise 2

Go to [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and pick a photo that you like. Using an image optimizing tool (or tools) of your choice, optimize the image for display on a website with a maximum width of `800px`.

See how many KBs you can strip out of the image while still maintaining an acceptable level of image fidelity.

Try doing a side-by-side comparison in a browser window of the original image (scaled down with code) and the optimized image (optimized to fit). Can you tell the difference?

# Optimizing Code

---
class: center, middle

### Rule No. 1 of Optimizing Code:

**Start with valid, error-free code!**

---

# Optimizing HTML

Optimizing your mark-up is as simple as following the basic best practices we already know:

- Don't use inline styles on your elements
- Avoid div-itis (important for a11y too)
- Remove commented-out code in production environments
- **Always test with the W3C Validator!** 
   If you have invalid HTML the browser will try to fix the errors however this can slow down the site significantly. [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

---
class: center, middle

.large[
   **Rules to live by:**<br />
   Load CSS in the `<head>`<br />
   Load JS right before `</body>`
]
<br />

---

# Optimizing CSS

CSS **performance** and **maintainability** are two peas in a pod:

- Make as few requests to stylesheets as possible, but consider using page-specific styles for larger sites
- Keep selector specificity under control
- Clean up unused styles
- Remove repetitive properties
- Be smart about how you write you media queries, you don't need to re-declare all CSS properties

---

# Optimizing JS

JS resources can significantly impact the CRP because they block DOM construction. 

Moving JS scripts to be just before the closing body tag helps to not block the HTML/CSS from displaying.

```html
<body>
   <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
   <!-- All the site content... -->

   <!-- load resources e.g. jQuery -->
   <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
   <!-- load your script last -->
   <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

---

# Optimizing Fonts

Modern browsers are smart about only loading the font files they need, but we still need to think about optimizing them:

- Add only the fonts you truly need to a website
- Only add the weights and subsets that you need (easily customized with Google Fonts or Font Squirrel)
- Make sure your fonts are cached (they rarely change!)
- [Optimizing Google fonts performance](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/06/optimizing-google-fonts-performance/)

---

# Third-Party Content

Third-party content/scripts such as ad servers or social buttons can be performance liabilities on your site because:

- They will require additional HTTP requests
- They will have page weight implications for your website, how large is the resource being loaded?

*Be smart about how you load third-party content!*

Would click rates improve if you allow ads, etc. to block rendering (so they are visible when the content loads), or defer loading of ads so the user sees the content sooner?

---

# Minification & Gzipping

Minification does things like removing whitespace, comments, and reducing hex code lengths. The good news is we are already doing this to our CSS and JS with Gulp!

Gzipping finds repetitive strings and replaces them with "pointers" to the first instance of that string. It must be done server-side (and how you do will depend on what kind of web server you're using).

**Doing both is ideal.** However since Gzipping requires server-side configuration it wont work for our current project. With WordPress there are [plugins](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/) that help with this. 

---

# Exercise 3

Let's better optimize the CSS and JS on our Aloha websites.

First, analyze the current state of your CSS. Run your CSS code through the **[CSS Stats](https://cssstats.com/stats/?link=https://redacademy.github.io/aloha-apparel/build/css/style.min.css)** and **[CSS Specificity Graph Generator](https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/specificity-graph/)** tools. Can you now see any obvious places where you could improve your CSS performance?

Next, adjust your `<script>` tags so they can no longer block content rendering on the page.

# Mobile-first Performance

---
class: center, middle

.large[
   Mobile-first is about more than how you write media queries.
]

---

# Thinking Mobile-first

Thinking mobile-first requires asking some key questions:

- *What is the main purpose of this page?*
- *What's the most important functionality or content?*
- *How do we optimize this for slower or less capable devices?*

**Don't assume that users need to see fewer things because they are on mobile devices.**

If you find yourself making judgements like this, then you should be asking why that content is there at all!

---
class: center, middle

### Optimized Image Loading FTW

We already know that we can make big performance gains by optimizing our images, but **how we load them** in our HTML and CSS for different screen sizes/types can do even more to improve site performance on mobile devices.

**TL;DR:** Load appropriately sized images for a given context.

---

# Background Images

**Pro-tip:** If you have a large background image you need to hide in your CSS, you must set `display: none` on the parent to prevent the browser from downloading the image anyway:

```html
<div class="parent">
    <div class="child"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.child {
   background-image: url('images/cat.png');
}

@media all and (min-width: 600px) {
   .parent {
      display: none;
   }
}
```

---

# Background Images

Also note that you can change background images with media queries. *Imagine if you have a background image of a team which looks good on desktop but on mobile it might crop the team members in strange ways.*

```css
.banner-image {
   background-image: url('images/mobile-team-banner.png');
   width: 100%;
   height: 100vh;
}

/* change the background image for devices >= 600px */
@media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
   .banner-image {
      background-image: url('images/tablet-team-banner.png');
   }
}
```

---

# Using srcset

We can also use the `srcset` attribute on an `<img>` element, which takes a comma-separated list of image URLs. Using the `x` descriptor allows you to load different versions of the same image for high-density displays e.g. retina and 4k:

```html
<img src="puppy.jpg"
   srcset="puppy.jpg 1x, puppy-large.jpg 2x"
   alt="An adorable puppy"/>
```

---

# Picture Elements

Instead of using media queries to load different images when the screen-size changes we can use the `<picture>` element with `<source>` tags which provide `media` and `srcset` attributes.

```html
<picture>
   <source media="(min-width: 40em)" srcset="puppy-landscape.jpg 1x,
   puppy-landscape-large.jpg 2x, puppy-landscape.jpg-hd.jpg 3x" />

   <source media="(min-width: 20em)" srcset="puppy-portrait.jpg 1x,
   puppy-portrait-large.jpg 2x, puppy-portrait-hd.jpg 3x" />

   <!-- Fallback if browsers don't support the <source> tag -->
   <img src="puppy-landscape.jpg" alt="An adorable puppy" />
</picture>
```

---

# Exercise 4

To get started, **[download the exercise files here](/public/files/exercises/picture-element.zip)**.

The exercise files contain three different images with regular and hi-res versions of each (6 images total).

Inside the `index.html` file, add a `<picture>` element that loads the `pug-portrait.jpg` for mobile, `pug-square.jpg` for `min-width: 420px`, and `pug-landscape.jpg` for `min-width: 1024px`.

Be sure to include the hi-res versions in the `srcset` attributes for high-density pixel displays, and use `pug-square.jpg` as a fallback for browsers that don't support `<picture>`.
