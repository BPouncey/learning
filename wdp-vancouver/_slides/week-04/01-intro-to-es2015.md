# The Bad Parts

## Review 

- End this section with block-scope and `this` 
- Transition to ES2015 with premise: Making JavaScript Better
- Mention JavaScript is highly transitional, and this is causing problems we'll see with React.

# Main improvements

- Global scope
- This
- Inheretance (class)
- Block scope
- Immutable values!
