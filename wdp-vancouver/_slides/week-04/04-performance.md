https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-minification-and-gzipping/

Minification does things like removing whitespace, removing comments, removing non-required semicolons, reducing hex code lengths...


Gzipping finds all repetitive strings and replaces them with pointers to the first instance of that string.

Gzipping is far more effective. Doing both is ideal.
