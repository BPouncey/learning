For Project 7, you'll be getting your GitHub portfolio into tip-top shape.

This work is one of the most important components of this course because you'll want to be sure you're showcasing your best work to the RED Talent Manager and our hiring partners!

## Requirements:

To receive a "Pass" grade for this project, you will need to revisit your Project 1-5 submissions and do the following:

**Project organization:**

- Remove unnecessary/redundant files (e.g. design comps, miscellaneous files from other projects, unused font files, etc.)
- Use lowercase letters when naming files and folders

**Code clean-up:**

- Ensure all you code is indented properly and free of unnecessary whitespace
- Ensure code is appropriately commented
- Use proper naming conventions:
   - semantic (meaningful) class and ID names in CSS, as well as JS and PHP variables and function names
   - lowercase letters for CSS ID and class names (dashed or underscores for whitespace)
   - camel case for JS variables and function names
   - lowercase letters and underscores for PHP variables and function names
- Follow all best practices discussed in class

**Incorporating feedback:**

- Fix all project requirements that were noted as "not complete" on your project evaluation forms
- Fix any other noted issues in the the "Comments" section of your project evaluation forms
- Fix outstanding issues posted by your instructors on your GitHub repos (close the issue once you have done this satisfactorily)

**Git/GitHub:**

- Ensure all projects should have a Git repo initialized in them and be pushed to GitHub (that means P1 and P2 too!)
- Make sure commit messages are meaningful (they should describe the changes that you are committing to your project)
- Add `README.md` files to all of your project repositories with content that meaningfully describes the project
- Ensure `.gitignore` files exclude all unnecessary files (e.g. all Node modules, etc.)

**Design fidelity:**

- Projects must look as close to the design as possible (i.e. they should look exactly like the demo sites)
- CSS/Sass should be organized and written as efficiently as possible to execute the design

**Functional requirements:**

- Projects must function as indicated in the "functional requirements" section of each project page (i.e. they should function exactly like the demo sites do)
- Be sure to **test** your project completely in **all major browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, IE10/11) when you think you're finished

## Submission Instructions

No need to submit this project&mdash;after the project due date your instructors will be reviewing all of your GitHub repositories to evaluate the improvements you made to your code.
