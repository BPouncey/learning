For your final project, you will work in groups to build a live, functioning version of a RED Community Project that has previously been through a UX process.

You will have to synthesize everything you have learned throughout the semester to best decide how to tackle your assigned project. It must incorporate all of the best practices we have learned about HTML, CSS, and JS/PHP. You must also use Git for version control, Gulp for task-running, and Sass as a pre-processor.

Your course instructors will be available in-class while you work on your project to provide assistance where required.

It is important that you **attend class everyday** during the final project lab time.

More details will be supplied regarding your assigned community partners and teammates in early March.

All Community Projects are **due on June 30th**. You will showcase your completed work with your team in a project demo to your classmates and instructors on that day.

When you're ready to submit your project, **please email a link to your GitHub repository containing your project** and **a link to the production version of your project** (if applicable) to [mandi@redacademy.com](mailto:mandi@redacademy.com).
