title: Project 1 / Part 2 - Aloha Homepage
due: Monday, April 25th (beginning of class)

For the second part of Project 1, you're going to level-up the Aloha Apparel Co. website by adding interactivity with JS.

You'll also add a navigation menu to the header and a new section to the page that showcases the different types of apparel products that Aloha sells.

And if you didn't complete the responsive stretch goal last week, you'll also need to optimize the website for the three required screen sizes.

You can [download the project files here](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/red-wdp/project-files/project-01b.zip).

## Design Specifications:

The design specifications are the [same as for the first part of Project 1](/project/project-1-part-1-aloha-homepage/).

## Requirements

As we are building on Project 1, all of the **[Part 1 requirements still apply](/project/project-1-part-1-aloha-homepage/)**.

Additionally, to receive a "Pass" grade for this project, your submission will need to satisfy the following criteria:

**HTML requirements:**

Your project must:

- Incorporate a list-based navigation menu

**CSS requirements:**

- Be refactored to use a mobile-first responsive layout using flexbox (no floats!)

**RWD requirements:**

Your project must:

- Be responsively designed using a mobile-first approach
- Be optimized for 3 screen sizes: mobile, `min-width: 600px` and `min-width: 1240px`

**JS requirements:**

Your project must:

- Incorporate "smooth scrolling" into the menu that navigates to specific points in the page
- Incorporate an image slider using a jQuery plugin for the featured product area ([bxSlider](http://bxslider.com/) is a good choice)
- Display an alert box that says "Thanks for subscribing!" whenever a user successfully submits the newsletter form with valid email address, otherwise they should see a message in the alert box that asks them to add a valid email address

**Additional requirements:**

Your project must:

- Take into account all feedback you received in the evaluation form for the first part of this project
- Include the four additional products to be added to the featured product area
- Include the new product categories grid
- Be sure to **test** your project completely in **all major browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, IE11) when you think you're finished

**Stretch goals:**

Want to challenge yourself? Your project could also:

- Update the the cart icon in the top-right corner of the header every time the user clicks the "Add to Cart" button for a product (see the additional stretch goal design comp in the project assets folder)
- Incorporate a fixed header at the top of the page (so that the navigation menu is always visible when the user scrolls down)

## Submission Instructions

When you're ready to submit your project, **please email a zip file containing your project assets** to [mandi@redacademy.com](mailto:mandi@redacademy.com).
