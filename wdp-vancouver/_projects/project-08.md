For your final project, you will be paired up with a student from the UX class, and you will be responsible for executing one of their designs in code.

Project possibilities may include building out a UX student's portfolio site on WordPress, or building out one of the other project they completed throughout the term (possibly on AngularJS, WordPress, etc.).

You will have to synthesize everything you have learned throughout the semester to best decide how to tackle your assigned project. It must incorporate all of the best practices we have learned about HTML, CSS, and JS/PHP. You must also use Git for version control, Gulp for task-running, and Sass as a pre-processor.

Your course instructors will be available in-class while you work on your project to provide assistance where required.

It is important that you **attend class everyday** during the final project lab time, and also maintain ongoing communication with your UX partner throughout.

More details will be supplied regarding who you will be partnered with and what your project will be on Monday, November 23rd.

All UX projects are due on December 11. You will showcase your completed work in a project demo to your classmates and instructors on that day.

When you're ready to submit your project, **please email a link to your GitHub repository containing your project** and **a link to the production version of your project** (if applicable) to [mandi@redacademy.com](mailto:mandi@redacademy.com).
