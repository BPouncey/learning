## Pre-Work

You'll need to complete the lab activity from the previous lesson (Intro to Redux).

---

## Learning Objectives

- Review how React components interact with pros and state.
- Identify the roles of React and Redux when used together to display views and store state.
- Use Redux to write state-free code in React.
- Use `react-redux`, with `<Provider>` and `connect`
- Use the `dispatch` prop to send actions to the Redux store from a React component.

---

## Keywords

- `Provider`
- `connect`
- `mapStateToProps`
- `mapDispatchToProps`

---

## Exercise 1

**Redux** and **React** serve different roles. Discuss with a partner the role of each in terms of handling:

- Data
- Views
- Logic
- Events

---

## Exercise 2

Before we install `react-redux`, install Redux and Redux dev tools in Boomtown just like we did in the earlier exercises this week.

Create a `redux` directory, and rough out the file and sub-directory structure. Set up your `store.js` just as we did for the grocery store exercise.

What kind of modules (i.e. action and reducer combos) do you think we'll need for this Boomtown?
