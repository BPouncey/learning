title: Building Things - Pick a Problem
---

## Summary

Software connected to the internet is a powerful force for change in the world. Knowing how to build software not only can provide you with a good living, it also empowers you to make life better, easier, more efficient, more fair for everyone who will use what you make. Building software isn't done in isolation, it requires teamwork and collaboration.

But, _how do you decide what to build?_ In the remaining modules in our course, we've set out a challenge to be completed in teams. You won't actually be writing any code, instead you will engage in the design and teamwork aspects that will be so important to your future career as a developer.

[Get ready to sprint.](https://www.gv.com/sprint/) To complete the remaining modules, we'll be using a slightly modified version of the GV (Google Ventures, formerly GoogleX) design sprint process!

## Self-Directed Activities

### Activity 1: Get Together

1. Meet together, online or offline and split the class into 2 groups

2. Convene each group and complete the following:
   - Choose one member from each group to be the leader / facilitator / decider (more on this later).
   - Envision your long-term goals for these modules. Answer questions like: "Where do we want to be at the end of these modules?".
   - Think critically. Ask yourselves questions like: "how could we fail?"
   - **Pick A Problem** you want to help solve using software. This step is critical, as your group will tackle this problem for the remaining modules.
   - Guidelines for picking a problem to tackle:
     - Think big, then think even bigger.
     - Don't spend too much time deciding the problem.
     - Consider the [UNHCR Sustainability Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) for some impactful problems to solve, if you can't think of any yourselves.

### Activity 2: Brainstorm a Solution

Get creative. Think of what you could build (a Web Service or app) to help solve the problem you identified. Keep it simple.

### Activity 3: Start at the End

Once your group has decided on the best potential solution:

1. Find a whiteboard, write your solution (software, end result) on the right, and your imaginary users ("actors") on the left.
2. Make a map of the steps your users will take to get to your desired solution. Create as many steps as you need.

### Activity 4: Pick a Target and Ideate

1. Pick one path through your map. This will be the path that we will focus our design efforts on.
2. Brainstorm again using the phrase "how might we" to come up with ideas for how you will tackle the steps in the path throgh your map.
   - Challenge yourself: come up with as many ideas as you can, we'll narrow down the best in the following module. Capture all of the ideas on post-it notes or in a journal.
