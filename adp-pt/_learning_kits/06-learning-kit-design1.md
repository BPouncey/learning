# Summary

Software connected to the internet is a powerful force for change in the world. Knowing how to build software not only can provide you with a good living, it also empowers you to make life better, easier, more efficient, more fair for everyone who will use what you make.

Building software isn't done in isolation, it requires teamwork and collaboration. In the remaining modules in our course, we've set out a challenge to be completed in teams. You won't actually be writing any code, instead you will engage in the design and teamwork aspects that will be so important to your future career as a developer.

We'll spend our time setting up for the following modules. We'll start by picking a problem we will try to tackle. We'll be using the GV (Google Ventures, formerly Google X) design sprint process!

# Self-Directed Activity

- Meet together, online or offline and split the class into 2 groups

- Once you've split into groups convene each group and complete the following:
  - **Pick A Problem** you want to help solve using software. This step is critical, as your group will tackle this problem for the remaining modules.
    - Some guidelines:
      - Think big, then think even bigger.
      - Don't spend too much time deciding the problem.
  - Choose one member from each group to be the leader / facilitator / decider (more on this later).
  - Envision a long-term goal. Answer: "Where do we want to be at the end of these modules?".
  - Think Critically. Ask and take notes about: "how could we fail?"
