title: Building Things - Pick a Problem
---

## Summary

Software connected to the internet is a powerful force for change in the world. Knowing how to build software can provide you with a good living, it can also empower you to make life better, easier, more efficient, more fair for everyone who will use what you make. Building software isn't done in isolation, it requires teamwork and collaboration.

But, _how do you decide what to build?_. In the remaining modules in our course, you will engage in the design and teamwork aspects that will be so important to your future career as a developer.

## Self-Directed Activities

### Activity 1: Get Together

1. Meet together, online or offline and split the class into 2 groups

2. Convene each group and complete the following:
   - Choose one member from each group to be the leader / facilitator / decider (more on this later).
   - **Pick A Problem** you want to help solve using software. This step is critical, as your group will tackle this problem for the remaining modules.
   - Guidelines for picking a problem to tackle:
     - Think big, then think even bigger.
     - Don't spend too much time deciding the problem.
     - Consider the [UNHCR Sustainability Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) for some impactful problems to solve, if you can't think of any yourselves.

### Activity 2: Who are the Actors?

Get creative. On a whiteboard, list all of the people who will use your system. We'll call these the "actors". List as many as you can think of on the left hand side of a whiteboard or piece of paper.

### Activity 3: Start at the End

So far you should have a whiteboard with your imaginary users ("actors") on the left. Now, on the right hand side, write a list of the potential outcomes for each actor. Don't worry abut grouping things, just write down the outcomes as you think of them we'll group them later.

### Activity 4: How Could We Fail?

The final activity is a meta-reflection on the project we've decided to undertake.

Once you have your whiteboard/paper with the actors on the left and your outcomes on the right. Step back and consider the following question: "How could we, as a group, fail to accomplish our goal?"

Take down all of the potential ways you come up with. Have them ready for a review, which you'll do at the start of the next module.
