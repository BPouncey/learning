## Activity

Build a "Hello World" application using a web framework that you are not using in this course (hint: we're using React). FOr example you may want to choose one of the following popular frameworks: 
 
 - [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
 - [Angular](https://angular.io/)
 - [Marko](https://markojs.com/)
 - [Ember](https://emberjs.com/)
 - [Backbone](https://backbonejs.org/)


## Reflection Journal


**"JavaScript fatigue is what happens when people use tools they don't need to solve problems they don't have."**
- Lucas F Costa (Source: twitter @housecor)

Write a reflection on one of the following questions: 

Why are there so many web-frameworks? Do you think that variety is good for innovation, or confusing for newcomers? Be sure to include your opinions and you personal experience.

All of the JavaScript frameworks in this module and in the course are open-source projects. This means that you're free to use the code they contain for your own projects. Besides making money, which some do, why would someone (or, some company) spend time building complex software for free?
