## Summary

Databases are a fundamental part of most software. In this module you're encouraged to dive a little deeper into the common database "architectures" and find out about how databases are designed. As a reflection we'll consider how "Cloud Computing" helps developers deploy databases, but more importantly we'll take time to consider how are personal data  from the apps that we use every day is stored, and the future of "Big-Data".

## Module Content

- Review: Types of Databases
- Intro to ACID transactions
- Intro to CAP theorem
- Investigate: What kind of databases are being used?
- Reflection: The future of Big-Data

## Self-Directed Work

### Activity

For this activity, choose 3 of your favourite apps and use google to discover what database technology they use. Specifically, see if you can find out the name (Postgres, MongoDB ... etc.), type (Relational, non-relational ...etc.) and try to determine which ACID tradeoffs they might make. When you're done, you'll compare your findings with your classmates. 

### Reflection Journal

Now that you know a little bit more about Databases, it;s time to think big about how data is commonly stored and accessed in modern computing. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cidZRD3NzHg) and write a reflection using 2 of the following ideas: 

- "Blockchain" is a new kind of "trustless" database, this makes it better than traditional centralized systems.
- Google's (and others') services rely heavily on storing an analyzing my personal data, like my location and text messages.
- Giving up my data to corporations is simply the price I must pay to use their services.
- Data privacy is only important to those who have nothing to hide.
- Corporations have my best interest in mind when they design their data-processing systems.
- There are viable alternatives to centralized data-warehouses like Google.
