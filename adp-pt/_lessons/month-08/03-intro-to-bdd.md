## Exercise 1

You've just been hired on as a big data consultant for a coding school called Rouge Academie. Management wants to understand more about their students!

Here's their **[data set](/public/exercises/bdd-dummy-data.json)**. Write 2 stories (each with at least 2 scenarios) about how you can provide them with insight.

For your reference:

- [What's in a Story?](https://dannorth.net/whats-in-a-story/)
- [A practical blog on how to write Scenarios using BDD](https://elabor8.com.au/a-practical-blog-on-how-to-write-scenarios-using-bdd/)

## Lab Activity (Next Class)

In today's lab, you'll finish `processData` from the last exercise, as you have a scaffold for the `processData` function.

Use your tests to guide you to completing its functionality. If you finish early, think about what other insights you can get from the data!
