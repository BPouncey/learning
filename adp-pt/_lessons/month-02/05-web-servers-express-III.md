## Learning Objectives

- Define what a "RESTful" architectural style is application development.

---

## Keywords

- HATEOAS
- Representational State Transfer (REST)
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

---

## Exercise 1

Finish writing the route handler for the `DELETE` request.

---

## Exercise 2

Refactor your route-related code to use `app.route()`.

---

## Exercise 3

In small groups or pairs, you'll be assigned one of the following topics to research (with respect to how it relates to REST) and deliver a short presentation to class on your findings:

- Data versus Resources versus Representations in REST
- State in REST: The idea of "statelessness" and the difference between resource state and application state
- The Richardson Maturity Model and where "hypermedia as the engine of application state" (HATEOAS) comes into play
- Safety and idempotence of HTTP verbs used in REST APIs

---

## Lab (Next Class)

We'll use the lab time to finish anything that was not completed during this lesson!
