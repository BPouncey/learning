## Learning Objectives

- Write and run a simple 'hello world' HTTP Server in Node
- Distinguish between Client and Server
- Create a 'hello world' HTTP server using Express
- Set up and deploy a Node Web Server using Express
- Write HTTP request handling logic using Express
- Make Web requests to 3rd party Web Servers using Express (APIs)
- Understand the term 'REST-ful'
- Use 'REST-ful' methods to communicate with your Express Server from a Web Browser

## Pre-Work

Knowing about HTTP is important but not part of this course.
To know more about HTTP you can start by looking at the documentation for
**http.request** [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/http.html#http_http_methods). 

*(Scroll down the page to find it)*<br /><br />
You'll need to know what the **port** and **protocol** options are for.
Check out the *sample code*. Run it and experiment with it.
