## Pre-work

Find five ways to improve the performance of your app. Be prepared enough to explain your findings to the class.

Read this [Google Developer article on Performance](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/?hl=en).

## Learning Objectives

- Use `performance.now()` to calculate the average duration of code.
- Estimate the scalability of functions using Big O.
- Become familiar with browser performance measuring tools such as Timeline and Sources. 
- Calculate time to first paint and re-render time for your site or app.
- Describe the **critical render path** and it's role in **render blocking**.
- Understand **jank** and how it can be prevented.
- Explain the benefits of using HTTP/2.

## Exercise 1

Create your own testing tool using `performance.now()`.

---

## Exercise 2

With a partner, calculate the Big O of given functions.

Choose three additional functions from your code and try to calculate the Big O of each. Compare your estimation with another student.

---

## Exercise 3

Prepare a list of performance improvements based on the reading from [Google Developer: Performance](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/?hl=en).

---

## Lab Activity

Apply various performance improvements to your projects.
