## Lesson Objectives

- write spies using Jest
- write stubs and mocks using Jest
- setup code coverage in Jest
- setup Jest to pre-compile Typescript

---

## Keywords
- shallow & mount rendering
- stub
- spy
- mock
- code coverage

---

## Pre-Work

- Read about [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/). Write three unit tests for React components using Enzyme.

---

## Exercise 1

Write unit tests for React components in the Worst Pokemon project.

---

## Exercise 2

Write unit tests for action creators and middleware in your Worst Pokemon project.

These tests should use **spies** or **mocks**.

---

## Exercise 3

Setup a test watcher with code-coverage reporting.

---

## Exercise 4

Setup your Worst Pokemon project to use pre-compiled TypeScript tests.s

---
