## Pre-Work

Complete the following readings before class:

- [Eloquent JavaScript - Higher Order Functions](http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html)
- Chapters 1-3 of [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide/blob/master/ch1.md)

---

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the differences between pure and impure functions, and write code that avoids side effects.
- Use common array methods (`.map`, `.filter`, `.sort`) for altering array data.
- Distinguish between `.forEach` and `.map`.
- Distinguish between `.push` and `.concat`.
- Use the spread operator (`...`) to avoid array mutation.
- Use `Object.assign` to avoid object mutation.
- Distinguish between **imperative** & **declarative** programming

## Exercise 1

Let's play the "Pure or Impure?" game.

---

## Exercise 2

Practice with array methods by trying the [Netflix Functional Tutorial](http://reactivex.io/learnrx/).

---

## Exercise 3

Each group will be given a topic.

You have 30 minutes to understand the concept and teach it to the class using examples.

- Spread (`...`)
- `Object.assign`
- `reduce`
- Destructuring
