## Learning Objectives

- Identify the differences between pure and impure functions, and write code that avoids side effects
- Use common array methods (`.map`, `.filter`, `.sort`)
- Distinguish between `.forEach` and `.map`
- Distinguish between `.push` and `.concat`
- Use the spread operator (`...`) to avoid array mutation
- Use Object.assign to avoid object mutation

## Keywords

- pure
- impure
- side effects
- mutation
- map
- reduce

---

## Exercise 1

Pure or Impure Game.

---

## Exercise 2

Practice with Array methods.

Try the [Netflix Functional Tutorial](http://reactivex.io/learnrx/)

## Exercise 3

Each group will get a topic.

You have 30 minutes to understand the concept and teach it to the class using examples.

  a. Spread (...)
  b. Object.assign
  c. Reduce
  d. Destructuring
