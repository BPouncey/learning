## Getting to Know Each Other (30)

Note: try to find common gaps in students knowledge and make a note.

### Name Stickers

Write your name on a tag and slap it on.

### Self Intro

- Start with the instructors.

### How you started programming

### A project you've created

### Why you want to make apps

### Commitment to this class

- time, energy, effort


## Ice Breaker (60)

In teams of 2-4, make a contraption that will spare an egg from breaking when dropped from the roof.

- 20 straws, roll of scotch tape, a piece of paper, a small box of eggs
- we will have one official egg drop from the roof

Ask students to discuss how building an egg drop contraption is similar to building an app.

Afterwards, discuss how building an app is a lot like dropping an egg.
- different approaches, some better than others
- different materials and restrictions (server, js, browser environments)
- testing (small drops)
- deployment (drop)

Explain how these approaches are how we're going to build our apps so they don't break when we deploy.

## Student Expectations (10)
