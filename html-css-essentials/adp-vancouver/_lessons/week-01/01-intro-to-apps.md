## Pre-work

#### Build a Random Colour Widget

- Create a function that outputs a random colour. The function should output the relevant colour values for hex, rgba and hsla.
- Feel free to use code you find on the internet, but be prepared to explain how it works.
- The JavaScript for your colour display widget should be written in ES2015. Modern browsers support this out-of-the-box, so you don't have to use Webpack or any other conversion tool. 
- The HTML / CSS should be written as a Web Component, or Custom Element, that uses the Shadow DOM to encapsulate the HTML / CSS for the element.
