For your final project, you will work in groups to build a mobile app for a RED Community Partner Project that has previously been through a UX/UI design process.

You will have to synthesize everything you have learned throughout the semester to best decide how to tackle your assigned project. It must incorporate all of the best practices we have learned about React and React Native, Redux, databases and testing. You must also use Git for version control and team collaboration.

Your course instructors will be available in-class while you work on your project to provide assistance where required.

It is important that you **attend class every day** during the final project lab time.

All Community Projects are **due on September 21st**. You will showcase your completed work with your team in a project demo to your community partner and instructors on that day.

More details will be supplied regarding your assigned community partners and teammates at the end of Week 7.
