- [ ] Use `propTypes` to document all component props (with no validation errors)
- [ ] Name components and component files/directories using Pascal case
- [ ] Use component lifecycle methods only where required
- [ ] Use React's Context API for state management where appropriate

### Functional Requirements

Your project must:

- [ ] Produce a "minimal viable product" base on the app idea
- [ ] Update the UI in real-time with the `withData` higher-order component
- [ ] Route between two or more pages in the app with React Router
