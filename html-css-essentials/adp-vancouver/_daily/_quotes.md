Percy:  The famous Stone of Galveston, My Lord.
Edmund: And what's that, exactly?

Edmund: I see. And what about it?
Percy:  Well, My Lord, the Infanta's eyes are bluer than it, for a start.
Edmund: I see. And have you ever seen this stone?
Percy:  (nods) No, not as such, My Lord, but I know a couple of people who

        seen is slightly less blue than something else you have never seen.
