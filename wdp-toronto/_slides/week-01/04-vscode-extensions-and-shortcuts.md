# What is VS Code?

Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control and GitHub, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.

# Shortcut keys to super-charge your efficiency

layout: false

Shortcuts that work almost anywhere:

⌘ + c: will make a copy of the highlighted item to your "clipboard".

⌘ + x: will make a copy of the highlighted item to your "clipboard", then delete the selection where it is.

BUT in VS Code if you do not specify a selection, it will automatically know to copy the entire line

⌘ + v: will insert the last thing you copied to your clipboard where your cursor is.

⌘ + w: will close the current tab you are on

⌘ + q: will close the entire window

Command Pallette:
⌘ + p: pulls up an autocompleting file explorer window

⌘ + shift + p: pulls up a list of all possible shortcuts and commands in VS Code (Customizable)

Alternatively you can open a new tab in VS Code displaying all possible VS Code shortcuts by pressing ⌘ + k + ⌘ + s

# ADD CODE to your command Path

⌘ + shift + p Then type "shell command" and select add 'code' command in PATH
