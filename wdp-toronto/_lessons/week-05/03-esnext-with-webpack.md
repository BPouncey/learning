## Pre-Work

Read the following articles before class:

* [Choosing a JavaScript Build Tool â€“ Babel, Browserify, Webpack, Grunt and Gulp](http://jamesknelson.com/which-build-system-should-i-use-for-my-javascript-app/)

Also take some time before class to explore the [Webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/) page.

---

## Learning Objectives

* Install the Webpack compiler in a development environment.
* Explore Webpack's CLI and 'loader' interface.
* Use Webpack to transform and bundle SCSS files.
* Use Webpack to set up source maps for compiled files (both CSS and JS).
* Use Webpack's development server to watch files and compile on save.
* Use npm scripts to run the Webpack CLI commands.
* Create JavaScript modules using the `import` and `export` keywords to write more modular code without polluting the global namespace.

---

## Keywords

* Module bundler
* Module loader
* Source map

## Exercise 1

Set up a **new project** with Webpack:

1.  Create a new folder for your project:
    * Remember to run `npm init` in your project's root directory.
    * Remember to create a `.gitignore` file and add `node_modules` at the top
2.  Create the following folders within:
    * `src`
    * `build`
3.  Create the following files:
    * `index.html` (in project root)
    * `main.scss` (in `src`)
    * `main.js` (in `src`)
    * `webpack.config.js` (in project root)

In `webpack.config.js` add the following code:

```js
const path = require("path");
module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/main.js",
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "build"),
    filename: "./bundle.js"
  }
};
```

Important: All of your `webpack.config.js` code will be inside of the above object separated by commas.

Run `npm install -g webpack` and then
run `npm install -g webpack-cli`

Once everything is set up we'll observe what happens when we run the following CLI commands:

* `webpack` for building once for development
* `webpack -p` for building once for production (minification)
* `webpack --watch` for continuous incremental build in development (fast!)
* `webpack -d` to include source maps

We'll experiment with the other CLI command options documented here:
https://webpack.js.org/api/cli

## Exercise 2

We'll want a development server to serve a webpage that contains our JavaScript bundle.

With Webpack, this is simple! Run: `npm install -g webpack-dev-server`

Once this command is finished, from the terminal in the root of your project run: `webpack-dev-server`

Now that you have a `webpack-dev-server` installed, let's add some configuration in our `webpack.config.js` file for our server.

```js
devServer: {
    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, "build"),
    compress: true,
    port: 9000
  }
```

Hold on, we are not done yet.

---

## Exercise 3

Now that we have our webpack server working, we should use `html-webpack-plugin` to dynamically generate an index.html file that can import our bundle.js file from the build dir.

With Webpack, this is simple! Run: `npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin`

Now, add this snippet to our `webpack.config.js` file to autogenerate `index.html` file in our `build` dir.

```js
// generate default index.html file in build dir
plugins: [new HtmlWebpackPlugin()];
```

Once this command is finished, from the terminal in the root of your project run: `webpack`

Great! you can check your `build` dir and you should be able to see two files, `index.html` file and `bundle.js` file.

Let's run start our server from terminal (in the roof of your project): `webpack-dev-server`

Congratulations, you have a development server that will reload your browser when you change the files in the `src` directory

---

## Exercise 4

Webpack can be used to bundle almost every kind of asset for the web. It's very flexible in this regard.

Let's use Webpack to compile our `.scss` files:

First, run the following commands (in your project's root directory):

* `npm install --save-dev sass-loader`
* `npm install --save-dev css-loader`
* `npm install --save-dev style-loader`
* `npm install --save-dev node-sass`

Next, add the following code to your webpack.config.js Inside the `rules` Array, after the JavaScript loader.

```js
// ...

module: {
  rules: [
    // ...other loaders...
    {
      test: /\.scss$/,
      use: [
        {
          loader: "style-loader"
        },
        {
          loader: "css-loader"
        },
        {
          loader: "sass-loader"
        }
      ]
    }
  ];
}

// ...the rest
```

Once you've added your loaders, `import` your `.scss` file into `main.js`, restart webpack-dev-server. Your `.scss` styles should visible in the browser.

---

## Exercise 5

Webpack can also be used to handle files, such as fonts and images.

`npm install --save-dev file-loader`

Add the following loader to your list of loaders in "webpack.config.js":

```js
{
  test: /\.(woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf)$/,
  use: [
        {
          loader: "file-loader",
          options: {
          name: "[path][name].[ext]"
          }
        }
  ]
}
```

Create `/public/fonts` folder in your project. Any fonts you import into your `.scss` from this folder will be added to `bundle.js`.

## Lab Activity

We'll install Webpack in our Instanews project and spend our time in class today removing Gulp, and replacing all functionality with its Webpack equivalent.
