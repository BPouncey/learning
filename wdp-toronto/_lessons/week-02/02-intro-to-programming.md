## Pre-work

_There is no pre-work for this lesson._

## Learning Objectives

- Define what "programming" is, as well as the essential mind set characteristics, tools, and skills of a professional programmer.
- Explore basic programming concepts such as statements, booleans, conditions, loops and variables in pseudocode.
- Define what an algorithm is.
- Use Scratch to build a basic program using graphical pseudocode.

## Keywords

- Algorithm
- Statement
- Boolean
- Variables
- Condition
- Loop
- Operator
- Function

## Exercise 1

Time to write some pseudocode of your own! You're going to use pseudocode to write an algorithm for washing a car.

Some things to consider while writing your algorithm:

- The weather...you don't want to wash you car if it's raining.
- Each individual step involved in washing the car. Remember that machines can only do exactly what we tell them to do.
- How long each step should take place. Is it something that happens only once, or does it need to happen repeatedly?

## Exercise 2

**How fast can you type?**

Lets get a sense of how fast you can type!

Let's visit [10 Fast Fingers](http://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english), create an account and take the typing test and share your WPM! <br/>
Once you've completed the english typing test. Let's see how fast you can type code! Visit [Typing.io](https://typing.io/) and sign in. Select the JavaScript test and start typing!

## Exercise 3

Your turn...**[create a Scratch account](https://scratch.mit.edu/)** and give it a whirl.

For this exercise, your first task is to create a basic program using one of the Scratch sprites (or more than one if you're feeling ambitious).

Your second task is to make sure you have fun with this :)

## Lab Activity

**Programming with Scratch:**

This lesson's lab is mostly a "choose-your-own-adventure" activity. You can create anything you want using Scratch (a game, an animated story, etc.) as long as it meets the following criteria:

- You must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat
- You must use at least three functions total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite)
- You must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable

**Writing READMEs:**

Part of being a great developer also means that you do a great job documenting your code.

It's a requirement for every project in this program to write a README explaining the work that you did on it, so during the last hour of today's lab you'll watch this Udacity tutorial, and begin writing a README for Project 1 using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

- [Writing READMEs](https://www.udacity.com/course/writing-readmes--ud777)

Be sure to commit your new `README.md` file to your project repo!
