## Learning Objectives

- Use "nonces" to securely make Ajax requests in WordPress.
- Use the `wp_localize_script()` function to pass data from the server side to the client side by making it available in JS variables.
- Identify the core use cases for the WP REST API plugin, install the plugin, and use it to update post data from the front-end of a website via an Ajax request.
