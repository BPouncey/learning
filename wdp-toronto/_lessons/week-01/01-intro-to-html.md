## Exercise 1

Your turn! Time to create your first webpage.

First things first...you need a code editor. Download and install VSCode (if you haven't done so already).

Next create a new folder somewhere on your computer and save a new file called `index.html`.

Then open that folder and create a simple webpage containing `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>` elements, then add a few paragraphs of text.

Lastly, save and view your new website in a browser.

## Exercise 2

Let's explore what these HTML5 elements are good for.

In teams of two, research your assigned element and report back to the class:

- What the semantically appropriate usage of the element is
- Any potential sources of confusion about this element's usage
- Where you think this element may be used in this week's project (if at all)

---

## Exercise 3

Let's dive right in and start thinking about how we might tackle the first project's design comp to convert it into semantically-appropriate HTML elements.

Jot some idea out on your own, then you'll pair up to discuss your approach with a partner. Based on this discussion, is there anything you'd revise in your approach?

Finally, you and your partner will share your insights with the class.

## Lab Activity

Today's lab time will be dedicated to Project 1.

Before you get started, you should watch this video to reinforce the concepts learned in class:

- [HTML - Hamburger Mark-up Language](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/02-html/)

You're goal for the end of the first day is to have the different sections of the [Project 1](project/project-1-part-1-aloha-homepage/) website roughed-out in HTML.

For help with how to get started, see the [RED HTML Wiki](https://redacademy.github.io/html-fundamentals/#setting-up-a-project).
