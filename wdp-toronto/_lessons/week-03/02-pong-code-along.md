## Pre-Work

### Prior to the OOP lesson:

Watch these videos from Laracast's [ES2015 Crash Course](https://laracasts.com/series/es6-cliffsnotes):

- [09: Classes](https://laracasts.com/series/es6-cliffsnotes/episodes/9)
- [10: ES6 Modules](https://laracasts.com/series/es6-cliffsnotes/episodes/10)

### Prior to the Pong code-along:

**Software installation:**

Please download and install Node.js:

- [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Note: If you are working on a Mac, [consider installing Homebrew first](http://brew.sh/), then use Homebrew to install Node instead by running:

`brew install node`

**Video to watch:**

Watch **the first 16 minutes** of this video for a brief introduction to Node and npm:

- [Node.js Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBNz5xF-Kx4)

_You can certainly watch the whole video if you have time, or bookmark it for later._

**Reading:**

We'll be creating SVGs to build the Pong game in Project 2, so you'll want to take a look through this guide before class:

- [Pocket Guide to Writing SVG](http://svgpocketguide.com/book/)

## Learning Objectives

- Explain what object-oriented programming is in the JavaScript context.
- Describe and instantiate objects using the new `class` syntax.
- Describe and use the elements of a `class`, including the `constructor` and 'methods'.
- Describe how the scope of `this` works within classes.
- Describe and use `extends` and `super` for inheritance purposes.
- Use `import` and `export` to import and export ES2015 classes to modules (as `default` or named exports).
- Code scalable vector graphics (SVGs) and add them inline to the DOM with JavaScript using OOP code.

## Exercise 1

Imagine you want to create an **object-oriented model of a soccer game**&mdash;what kind of class "blueprints" would you need to create to represent all of the elements of the game as objects (e.g. a player, the ball, etc.)?

What kinds of **properties** (i.e. adjectives/traits) would be needed to describe each object, and what kinds of **methods** (i.e. verbs/actions) would be available to each object?

Work in groups to create a **poster-based representation** your object-oriented soccer game, and present your work to the class.

---

## Exercise 2

Pick one of the classes your group modeled in the previous soccer game exercise, and use that to **write your first ES2015 class**.

Ensure that you set all the appropriate **properties** in the `constructor` and create all the required **methods** for your class.

---

## Exercise 3

Now model our own classroom using the following classes. Note that `WebDevStudent` should be a subclass of `Student` and `Student` should be a subclass of `Person`. Create at least **three properties** and **one method** on each class.

- Clazz \*
- Person
- Student
- WebDevStudent

_(note: class is a keyword in JavaScript, and thus cannot be a valid name)_<br />

_Instantiate your classmates using_ `new WebDevStudent()`.

## SVGs: Exercise 1

Use `<circle>`, `<rect>`, and `<line>` elements to draw an old-timey radio. The viewport and `viewBox` should be `400` by `260` pixels. All elements have a `stroke-width` of `5`:

<img src="/public/files/exercises/svg-radio-mockup.jpg" alt="SVG radio mock-up" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />

## Lab Activity

We can now commence work on Project 3 using what we've now learned about OOP, JS class syntax, and SVGs.

Clone the "Pong Starter" to get started.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redacademy/pong-starter
cd pong-starter
npm install
npm start
```

We will build the project code-along style as a class. Refer to the [project requirements page](/project/project-3-pong-game/) and the [building a Pong game slide deck](/slides/building-a-pong-game/) for further instructions.
