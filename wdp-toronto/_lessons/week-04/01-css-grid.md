## Pre-Work

Prior to class, download and install Firefox Developer Edition:

- [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)

---

## Learning Objectives

- Construct a simple layout using CSS Grid container properties and values such `display: grid | inline-grid | subgrid;`, `grid-template-columns`, and `grid-template-rows`.
- Explain the difference between grid tracks and lines.
- Use grid-specific developer tools to help build and debug of CSS Grid layouts.
- Apply flexible measurement units such as `fr` to a grid-based layout.
- Use CSS Grid methods such as `minmax()` and `repeat()` in a grid-based layout.
- Use `grid-template-areas` to fine-tune a grid-based layout.

## Exercise 1

`%`, `em`, `rem`, `auto`, `vw`, and `vh`

After seeing these **responsive units** again, let's take a few minutes and discuss what we know about them and research what we don't.

At your tables discuss with each other your findings. After a few minutes we can take a further look at some examples.Research these responsive units & at your table discuss your findings.

---

## Exercise 2

Take a look at some of the grid examples on [GridByExample.com](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/).

Inspect the site with Firefox dev tools. See if you notice anything interesting. How could you apply what you see here to previous project you've worked on?

Discuss your findings with a partner or in small groups.

## Lab Activity

### Task 1: CSS Grid Garden

Today's lab is primarily dedicated to getting comfortable with the CSS Grid properties and values, and then get creative with it.

Start by reinforcing what you just learned in class by completing this tutorial:

- [CSS Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/)

### Task 2: Create your own grid art!

Practice using CSS Grid to create a layout (or layouts) of your choosing.

As an example, here's creative use of CSS Grid:

<iframe height='340' scrolling='no' title='aqbeQY' src='//codepen.io/Onomicon/embed/aqbeQY/?height=340&theme-id=light&default-tab=result&embed-version=2' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='https://codepen.io/Onomicon/pen/aqbeQY/'>aqbeQY</a> by Onomicon (<a href='https://codepen.io/Onomicon'>@Onomicon</a>) on <a href='https://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

<br />And here's an example of a Mondrian-inspired grid you could attempt to recreate:

Come with an idea, sketch it out on paper and have some fun with this!

_We will demo our grid creations for the class at the end of day._
