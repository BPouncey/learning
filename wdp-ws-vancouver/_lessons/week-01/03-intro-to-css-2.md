## Exericse 1

Add the [Eric Meyer reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) to your Project 1. Do you notice anything different when you refresh your browser?

---

## Exercise 2

Both of the stretch goals for Project 1 will require positioning properties to style it. With a partner, discuss how you would implement the cart icon stretch goal in CSS. Draw it out on paper if it helps!

## Exercise 3

There are two components to this exercise&mdash;adding some colour, and beginning to add background images.

Change the colour of the links and the orange headings to `#e2574c`.

Also add the floral background image to the banner area.

**Challenge!** How could we get the partially transparent background layer and the photo of the girl to sit on top of this image (also as a background)?

---

## Homework

Continue working on your Project 1 based on what you've learned so far.

Also, one more video to watch to help reinforce the concepts learned in class:

- [Don't Fear Layout](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/08-layout/)

By the end of the second CSS lesson you should have a enough CSS written to begin approximating the rough layout of your Project 1 website.
