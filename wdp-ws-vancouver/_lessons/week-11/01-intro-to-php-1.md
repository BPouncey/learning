## Additional Resources

PHP is a well-documented language and you can find its docs here:

* [Documentation](http://php.net/docs.php)

An awesome, well-written PHP resource:

* [PHP the Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com/)
* At the very least, [read this chapter](http://www.phptherightway.com/pages/The-Basics.html)

This online book is a bit dated, but the following chapter is still relevant and very explanatory:

* [Hacking with PHP - How PHP is Written](http://www.hackingwithphp.com/2/6/0/how-php-is-written)
