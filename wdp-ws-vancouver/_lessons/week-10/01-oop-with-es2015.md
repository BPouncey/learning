## Pre-Work

Watch these videos from Laracast's [ES2015 Crash Course](https://laracasts.com/series/es6-cliffsnotes):

* [09: Classes](https://laracasts.com/series/es6-cliffsnotes/episodes/9)
* [10: ES6 Modules](https://laracasts.com/series/es6-cliffsnotes/episodes/10)

We'll be creating SVGs to build the Pong game in Project 3, so you'll want to take a look through this guide before class:

* [Pocket Guide to Writing SVG](http://svgpocketguide.com/book/)

## Learning Objectives

* Explain what object-oriented programming is in the JavaScript context.
* Describe and instantiate objects using the new `class` syntax.
* Describe and use the elements of a `class`, including the `constructor` and 'methods'.
* Describe how the scope of `this` works within classes.
* Use `import` and `export` to import and export ES2015 classes to modules (as `default` or named exports).
* Code scalable vector graphics (SVGs) and add them inline to the DOM with JavaScript using OOP code.

## Exercise 1

Imagine you want to create an **object-oriented model of a soccer game**&mdash;what kind of class "blueprints" would you need to create to represent all of the elements of the game as objects (e.g. a player, the ball, etc.)?

What kinds of **properties** (i.e. adjectives/traits) would be needed to describe each object, and what kinds of **methods** (i.e. verbs/actions) would be available to each object?

Work in groups to create a **poster-based representation** your object-oriented soccer game, and present your work to the class.

---

## Exercise 2

Pick one of the classes your group modeled in the previous soccer game exercise, and use that to **write your first ES2015 class**.

Ensure that you set all the appropriate **properties** in the `constructor` and create all the required **methods** for your class.

## Lab Activity (Remainder of the Week)

### Warm-up Round

Use `<circle>`, `<rect>`, and `<line>` elements to draw an old-timey radio. The viewport and `viewBox` should be `400` by `260` pixels. All elements have a `stroke-width` of `5`:

<img src="/public/files/exercises/svg-radio-mockup.jpg" alt="SVG radio mock-up" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />

### Pong Code-Along

Now you'll commence work on Project 3 using what you've now learned about ES2015 syntactical features and Webpack to build a Pong game.

Clone the "Pong Starter" to get started.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redacademy/pong-starter
cd pong-starter
npm install
webpack
npm start
```

Refer to the [project requirements page](/project/project-3-pong-game/) and the [building a Pong game slide deck](/slides/building-a-pong-game/) for further instructions.
