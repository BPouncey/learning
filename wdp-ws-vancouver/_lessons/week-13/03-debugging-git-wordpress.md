## Exercise 1

Install Theme Check and Debug Bar.

Try running Theme Check now. What message do you see?

If the Debug Bar link in the Admin bar is orange or red, be sure to investigate those warnings.

## Exercise 2

Time to add some version control to your project.

Initialize a Git repository in your project's `wp-content` directory in MAMP, add the `.gitignore` file as recommended, stage your files, make your commit, add a remote from GitHub, and push your code!

## Homework

For homework over the break week, please continue to work on Project 4.

Specifically, you'll want to ensure the the blog index and single post page templates are fully implemented and styled with CSS before you return.

**Be sure to make regular commits to your project repo as you work!**
