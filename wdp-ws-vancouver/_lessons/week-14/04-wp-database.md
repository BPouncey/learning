- Relational database
- MySQL

## Exercise 1

Let's explore WP's database tables in greater depth. You'll be assigned a table, and it's your job to figure out:

- what it's for
- what data is stored in there (the columns!)
- what other tables it's linked to

You will **create a poster** to illustrate what you've discovered.

After you're done researching your table and creating your visual explanation of it, we'll share our findings as a group.

## Homework

Continue working on Project 4 based on what you've learned so far.
