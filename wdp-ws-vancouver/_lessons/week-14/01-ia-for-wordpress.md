## Exercise 2

Using the sample IA provided, work in a group to decide how you would build that website out using appropriate WordPress APIs. Specifically, determine:

- Can you leverage built-in WP posts, pages, categories or tags in this IA? Where?
- Will you need any custom post type or taxonomies?
- What templates from the Template Hierarchy would you make use of in your theme? What would the files be named?

When done, you will present your rationale to the class.

## Homework
