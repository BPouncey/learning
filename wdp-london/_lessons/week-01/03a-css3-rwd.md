## Pre-Work

Readings from _Learn to Code Advanced HTML & CSS_:

- [Responsive Web Design](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/responsive-web-design/)

Also read through this article by Ethan Marcotte, which is widely credited with kicking off the responsive web design movement:

- [Responsive Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/)

## Learning Objectives

- Distinguish the differences between CSS2 and CSS3.
- Explore other CSS3 features such as `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, gradients, and `opacity`.
- Define "responsive web design" and its three components.
- Distinguish between fixed, fluid, adaptive, responsive, and mobile-only websites.
- Convert a fixed-width, desktop-sized website to be responsive (optimized for multiple breakpoints) using a mobile-first approach.

## Exercise 1

Your task is to find an example of a responsively-designed website. Take notes on:

- Where are the main "breakpoints"? What happens at these breakpoints?
- What happens to the navigation for mobile widths?
- Are there ads on the site? How are they handled?
- Does anything seem to be not-quite-right at any width?

Afterward, we'll pair up and share our findings.

## Exercise 2

Let's try converting a desktop-only website to be fully responsive and mobile-first.

You'll be optimizing for two breakpoints: `480px` and `720px`

Screenshots of what the website should look like at mobile, tablet, and desktop width have been included in the following package:

## Exercise 3

Now that we've had a chance to brush up our RWD skills, let's strategize how we'll apply this to our Project 1.

Take a few moments to review the two narrower design comps and think about what areas of the site will specifically be affected by the changes that are happening at each breakpoint.

Jot some idea out on your own, then you'll team up to discuss this with a partner. We'll then reconvene to discuss each others findings, as well as any questions or concerns before starting with the lab work.

## Exercise 4

Let's teach each other about these CSS3 properties...

Your task is to take your assigned property and create a demo of how it can be used for your classmates.

Also take a look at Project 1, and see if you can recommend where it this property could potentially be used (if at all).

---

## Lab Activity

We'll continue to work on Project 1 in today's lab.

Your goal for today is to "refactor" your CSS into mobile-first media queries based on the provided design comps.
