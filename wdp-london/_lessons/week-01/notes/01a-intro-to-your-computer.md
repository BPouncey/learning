# Your Computer

## PC vs Mac

Get an understanding of Mac vs PC usage in the class.

## Spotlight

Think/Pair/Share: how do you open an application or file you've never used before?

Debrief:
- Identify that you don't need to memorize your filesystem in order to open things
- Identify how hotkeys can speed your workflow

OSX:

Introduce Spotlight - Cmd + Space

Windows:

The 'Windows' key has a similar behaviour to Spotlight

## Discussion: Application Dependencies

Show of hands: Has everyone installed Chrome and VSCode?

If not, break into groups. The people who haven't installed the software talk through how they would go about installing new software while they install it.

Debrief:
- Efficiencies in finding and installing new software
- Pitfalls of installing software from the web

## Activity: Create shortcuts.txt

Individually: Create a RED directory

- Open VSCode
- Open the Desktop Folder as a project
- Create a new folder called `RED`
- In that folder, create a text file called shortcuts.txt
- Add a the Spotlight hotkey to shortcuts.txt
- Ask them to add shortcuts to that file incrementally

Debrief:
- Multiple ways to create files
- File naming conventions & consistency
- File extensions

## Activity: Filesystem

In Groups: Draw how you think files are organized on your machine.
Use their prework folder as an example.

Debrief:
- Show files as a tree
- Show the Finder view that demonstrates the file tree
- Talk about hierarchy, and how we represent it using `/` in OSX, and `\` in Windows.

Ie. `Users/blaketurner/Desktop` Represents three tiers of hierarchy by using `/`.

## Activity: Cmd + Tab

Open Google Chrome and VSCode. Navigate between them 10 times.

Debrief:
- How did you achieve the activity. Was your method easy?

Introduce Cmd + Tab. Repeat 10x navigation activity.

(Add to shortcuts.txt)

## Activity: Moving windows with hotkeys

Put your VSCode and Google Chrome windows Side by Side

Debrief:
- How did you achieve the activity. Was your method easy?

OSX:

Download [Spectacle App](https://www.spectacleapp.com/)

Windows:

This ships by default starting in Windows 10.
Windows Key + left/right/up/down, you can alsodo quarters by pressing up+right, etc.
OR you can drag windows to the side and they snap in place.

Once apps have been downloaded and hotkeys introduced, repeat the side-by-side activity.

(Add to shortcuts.txt)

## Activity: Multiple Desktops

Open up another Chrome window. Stretch it to fix your screen. Then make the half-size VSCode and Chrome windows visible.

Debrief:
- Did Cmd + Tab cause problems?
- Was it difficult to choose which window was in the foreground w/ just Cmd + Tab?

Introduce multiple desktops:

OSX:

Four finger swipe up reveals the desktops view.
You can create a new one by clicking the + on the right, and move windows to new desktops by dragging them there.
Four finger swipe down returns to normal view.

Windows:

ctrl-D to create desktops
ctrl-left, ctrl-right to move between desktops

Once you've shown how to make multiple desktops, move side by side windows to one desktop, new Chrome window to other desktop.
Navigate between w/ gestures.

(Add to shortcuts.txt)

## Activity: Gestures

Open System Preferences using Spotlight. Don't touch your mouse/touchpad!
Visit the Trackpad section. Spend 5 minutes on Gestures, adding to shortcuts.txt as you go.

Get Windows users to Google any gestures specific to their hardware.

## Activity: Key Repeat

NOTE: Key repeat is only visible in Terminal on OSX (everything else blocks key repeat), so this might be better to introduce when we

Go to shortcuts.txt press and hold any key. Why is it so slow?

Open System Preferences -> Keyboard, change key repeat speed. Try again in shortcuts.txt.

## Activity: Three-finger Drag

Go to System preferences -> Accessibility -> Mouse & Trackpad -> Trackpad options.
Enable three-finger dragging.

Play for two minutes dragging things around.

## Challenge

It's race time. We're going to record ourselves performing a bunch of power-user tasks using Quicktime screen recording, or if you're on windows, the honour system.

Note: to stop the creen recording, press the 'Stop' button that appears in the toolbar on the top right.

Tasks:

- Open Chrome
- Make window 1/2 of screen
- Open a new Chrome window
- Make window the other half of the screen
- Open VSCode
- Make VSCode window full screen
- Move VSCode to a new Desktop
- Open a new Chrome Window
