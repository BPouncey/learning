title: Project 3 - Coding Interview
due: Monday, March 4th (beginning of class)
class: gh-check

The task for your coding interview is to implement a vending machine in JavaScript.

The vending machine itself should be a Javascript class. You do not need to write an interface for using the vending machine, just tests to prove that it works.

## Requirements

To receive a “Complete” for this project, your submission will need to satisfy the following criteria:

### Development Workflow Requirements

Your project must:

- [ ] Demonstrate effective organization of the project's root directory
- [ ] Have a Git repository initialized in its root directory which is pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Use a `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files/folders, and ensure that no unnecessary files/folders are erroneously committed to the repository
- [ ] Contain an appropriate number of commits for the scope of the project
- [ ] Use properly-formatted commit messages
- [ ] Contain a `README.md` file describing the project (e.g. technologies used, personal learnings, installation instructions, etc.) and is appropriately formatted with Markdown
- [ ] Remove extraneous code and comments from files
- [ ] Contain a `package.json` with all applicable fields completed
- [ ] Run app without errors
- [ ] Contain a build directory with code correctly compiled/transpiled and minified for production
- [ ] Use Prettier to format code

### JavaScript / Node.js Requirements

Your project must:

- [ ] Define variables where needed with `let` and `const`
- [ ] Use functions to effectively organize code
- [ ] Use consistent, descriptive variable and function names
- [ ] Check for strict equality with comparison operators
- [ ] Demonstrate effective use of control flow (loops, conditionals, etc.)
- [ ] Use objects and arrays (and their built-in methods) to effectively work with data
- [ ] Use `require`/`module.exports` where appropriate

### Functional Requirements

Your project must:

- [ ] Contain at least 10 well-formed, passing tests
- [ ] Contain a reasonably DRY (don't repeat yourself) implementation, though the tests can be verbose
- [ ] Use `describe` and `it` correctly so the test output specifically describes the behaviour of the code
- [ ] Have a screenshot in the repository's `README.md` of the test output from the terminal
- [ ] Use a ES2015 `class` to build the vending machine
- [ ] Print vending machine inventory
- [ ] Refill vending machine inventory
- [ ] Re-supply vending machine change
- [ ] Dispense inventory based on payment
- [ ] Return change as coins (e.g. \$0.35 is 1 quarter and 1 dime)

### Stretch Goals

Want to challenge yourself? Your project could also:

- [ ] Dispense the fewest number of coins possible when returning change
- [ ] Allow variable products in any slot
