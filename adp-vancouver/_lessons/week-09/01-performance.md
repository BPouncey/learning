## Pre-work

Find 5 ways to improve the performance of your app. Be prepared enough to explain your findings to the class.

Read this [Google Developer article on Performance](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/?hl=en). 

---

## Learning Objectives

- use `performance.now()` to calculate the average duration of code
- estimate the scalability of functions using **big O**
- become familiar with browser performance measuring tools such as "timeline" and "sources" 
- calculate time to first paint and re-render time for your site or app
- describe the **critical render path** and it's role in **render blocking**
- understand **jank** and how it can be prevented
- explain the benefits of using HTTP/2

---

## Keywords

- performance.now
- big O
- first Paint Time
- re-render time
- render blocking
- deferred scripts
- HTTP/2

---

## Exercise 1

Create your own testing tool using `performance.now()`. 

---

## Exercise 2

With a partner, calculate the "big O" of given functions.

Choose three additional functions from your code and try to calculate the big O of each. Compare your "estimation" with another student.

---

## Exercise 3

Prepare a list of performance improvements based on the reading from [Google Developer: Performance](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/?hl=en).

---

## Lab Activity

Apply various performance improvements to your projects.
