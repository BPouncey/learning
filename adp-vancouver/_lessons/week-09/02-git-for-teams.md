## Lab Activity

In today's lab we'll set up our GitHub environment for our Community Projects:

**Install the ZenHub Chrome extension:**

The ZenHub extension turns github into a project management platform. We'll be using the Boards feature. Boards are a simple Kanban system for tracking issues as tasks in github.

**Set up the following boards:**

- New issues
- In Progress
- Review / QA
- Closed

**Issue lifecycle demo:**

Once the board is set up, as a class we'll demonstrate our workflow using feature branches with pull requests submitted from them to production.

We'll be using GitFlow techniques to manage commits into this repository. *All commits to produciton must be in the form of a pull request.*
