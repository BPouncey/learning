## Objectives

- Identify the differences between pure and impure functions, and write code that avoids side effects
- Use common array methods (`.map`, `.filter`, `.sort`)
- Distinguish between `.forEach` and `.map`
- Distinguish between `.push` and `.concat`
- Use the spread operator (`...`) to avoid array mutation
- Use Object.assign to avoid object mutation

## Pre-Work

- Eloquent Javascript - [Higher Order Functions](http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html)
- Chapters 1-3 Professor Frisby's ["Mostly Adequate Guide'](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide/blob/master/ch1.md)

## Keywords

- pure, impure functions, side effects, mutation
- map, reduce

## Active Learning

1. Pure or Impure Game.

2. Practice with Array methods. Try the [Netflix Functional Tutorial](http://reactivex.io/learnrx/)

3. Each group will get a topic. You have 30 minutes to understand the concept and teach it to the class using examples.

  a. Spread (...)
  b. Object.assign
  c. Reduce
  d. Destructuring
