## Topics/Questions

- browser history
  - why?
  - how it works

- view urls on other websites
  - Medium (what is a hash at the end, why is it there?)
  - Reddit

- what is a hash

- issues with relative/absolute paths
`<Link to="path/1">Link</Link>` - adds paths on the end of the current path
This can result in "http://localhost:8000/path/path/path/path/1"
Use an absolute link: `<Link to="/path/1">Link</Link>`

## Directions

- clearer directions in lab activity about:
  - using routes for sorting (newest, popular)
    - how to filter down to one component (not best solution)
    - how to use lifecycle methods to load that one component
