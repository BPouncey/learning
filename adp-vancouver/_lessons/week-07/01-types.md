## Pre-Work

Complete the following readings before class:

- [Why TypeScript](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/why-typescript.html)
- [Why you shouldn't be scared of TypeScript](https://scotch.io/tutorials/why-you-shouldnt-be-scared-of-typescript)
- [Flow](https://flowtype.org/)

---

## Learning Objectives

- Explain how types help you avoid errors in your code
- Setup type checking in your editor and project
- Write effective types, interfaces, and generics for existing code
- Install type declaration files for common libraries using flow-type
- Write types for existing React and Redux code.

---

## Keywords

- Compiler
- Primitive
- Type inference
- Interface
- Generic
- Namespace
- Declaration files

---

## Exercise 1

Compare [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/) with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/repl/) compiled results in ES5.

---

## Exercise 2

Walk-through the different ways of writing types in Jest:

- Type inference
- Types
- Interfaces
- Generics
- Declaration files

---

## Lab Activity

Setup a project to use Jest. Be sure to include:

- React with Webpack
- a ".flowconfig" file
- files leading with `// @flow`
- Specified types & interfaces
- Specified declaration files
- `babel-plugin-transform-flow-strip-types` to remove types from output
