- Understand Semver conventions.
- `merge` a "Release branch" into production.
- Create a feature branch and add a feature and use it to add a feature.
- `tag` a merge commit containing a production release using Semver conventions.
- `stash` some changes and re apply them to your code later.
- Use the `cherry-pick` command to add a commit from another branch without merging.
- Learn strategies for working with & maintaining repos with lot's of branches.
- Use a git hook to validate a `git push`.
