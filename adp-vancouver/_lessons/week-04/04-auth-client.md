## Lab Activity

In todays Lab, we'll spend the day writing the necessary code to perform login and signup from our
client application, as well as write the necessary (client-side) code to restrict the display of pages
when a user is not signed in. This will be the final day of in-class work on boomtown. We can also make use of this time to address any concerns you might have and tie up loose ends with your project before the weekend.
