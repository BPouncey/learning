#Git Review

Create a folder with an index.html, style.css and main.js file.
```
Git init
```
```
cd .git
```
This is where all git settings and information is located at the root of our directory

---
#Create a new Repository

after you have created a new repository on github write
```
git remote -v
```
Is the location correct?

#Git Clone

Copy remote repos to local machines with git clone:

https://github.com/BFriz/git

What is there? Can you fix the code and commit to your own repo?

**bonus: figure out to commit without deleting .git

---
#What do these do

git fetch
git merge
git pull

and what do they have to do with each other

git pull is like writing git pull

---
#Git Branch

git checkout -b [branch_name]

---
#Git Merge
