# What is Node?

---
class: center, middle

### Node was created in **2009**, and since then has become the driving force behind the widespread adoption of the **JavaScript** programming language as a tool for developing sophisticated software applications.

Node.js provides the minimum viable foundation to support the main Internet protocols, and OS interface.
#### Given its  low-level API, any reasonably complex application needs to make extensive use of libraries.

---

# Experienced Node Developers Know...

- How to structure an application using multiple 3rd party modules, and how to reliably judge the quality of a 3rd party module
- How to leverage the **Event Loop** and Node's **Async**, single-threaded nature (more on this to come!)
- How to use various Networking Protocols

# What is Node?

Node's most useful features are: <br/>
The **event loop** and **non-blocking I/O**

Node programs are **single threaded** and **highly parallel**

# A Simple Node Application

# Building a TCP Service

**TCP & UDP** are the basic protocols of the internet. (nearly ) **All network communication on the internet is carried out by these 2 protocols.**

### Take a minute to [read this link](http://www.diffen.com/difference/TCP_vs_UDP), for a good description of the differences between TCP & UPD, and how they are used.

When you're finished, create a folder called `TCP_Service`. Inside the folder run the command `npm init`.

---

# Building a TCP Service

Your `package.json` should look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "intro-to-node-exercises",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Learning Node @ Red Academy",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "MK <mackenzie@redacademy.com>",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

## Why do we need this?

---

# Building a TCP Service
- **Create a file called `index.js`** <br/>

Use Node's built-in [`net` module](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html), 
to create a server which will handle incoming network connections (TCP/UDP).
```js
const net = require('net')
const server = net.createServer();

server.on('connection', handleConnection);

server.listen(9000, function() {
  console.log('server listening to %j', server.address());
});


function handleConnection() {
  // TODO: Handle connection!
}

```

.footnote[*Run this code by typing `node index.js`*]


---

# Building a TCP Service

In order to show when the **server** has recieved a connection from a **client**,
we'll need to add some code to the `handleConnection` callback.

```js
function handleConnection(conn) {
  const remoteAddress = `${conn.remoteAddress}:${conn.remotePort}`;
  console.log(`new client connection from ${remoteAddress}`);
}
```

- **Add the `conn` parameter and `console.log` connection details when a connection happens!**

## Where is the client?

.footnote[*Note: Socket in this context is not WebSocket*]

---

# Simple Netcat Client

**We'll use Netcat to test our nre TCP/UDP server.**

Start your server new TCP Server, and from your command line in a separate terminal window, run:
```bash
 nc localhost 9000
```

You should see something like this in the terminal where your server was started:
```bash
new client connection from ::1:63342
```

**Take 5 minutes and read about the [Netcat](http://nc110.sourceforge.net/) tool.**

### Congratulations, you've successfully created a new network 'node' and connected it to the internet!

It doesn't do anything useful yet.
Before we can start sending and recieving data, we'll need to add a few more things...

---

# Exercise 1

Implement the following `conn` event handlers in your `handleConnection` callback:

- #### 'data'
- #### 'close'
- #### 'error'

Each handler should `console.log` the `remoteAddress` as well as any relavent parameters (e.g. incoming data, or error messages).
Review the documentation here before you begin: [https://nodejs.org/api/net.html](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html)

---

# UTF8

If you're sending incoming data to the server console, you may have noticed somehting like this `<Buffer 9c 4f 4f 4f>` in the output.

This happens because TCP sends **streams of bytes** acrocss the network, and it's up to our application to decode them properly!

## What is utf8?

# Debugging a Node Applcation

---

# V8 Inspector Integration

To debug a node applcation, start the node process using the following command:

```bash
node --debug --inspect index.js
```
You should see output in your teminal:
```bash
Debugger listening on port 9229.
Warning: This is an experimental feature and could change at any time.
To start debugging, open the following URL in Chrome:
    chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html?experiments=true&v8only=true&ws=127.0.0.1:9229/3b270900-1c51-460c-a7a4-d593f462b2d7
```

Copy & paste the `chrome-devtools://` url into a new chrome tab to start your debugging session.

---

Open your debugger and set a breakpoint somewhere in your code. Send a message to your server using Netcat to trigger it!

<img src="/public/img/slide-assets/node-debugger-breakpoint.png" />

---

# Exercise 2

Use the debugger and set a breakpoint in your `data` event handler. Intercept the incoming data, and use the debugger's console to change the value
of the data parameter (the incoming data) before it's logged.

(Use Netcat to send data to your new TCP service)

When you're finished, watch this video from Google I/O!

---

# Completed TCP Service

Finally, lets return some data from our service. At the moment does not send any information back to the client.

Add the following code to your `data` handler to complete the service.

```js
    // console.log ...
    conn.write(
      `Got "${d.trim()}". Let me uppercase: "${d.toUpperCase()}"`
    )
```

Now, we have a friendly uppercasing service!

# Load Testing

Lets try to understand what our new Node process (uppercasing service) is doing while it's running. <br/>
**Install the following tools:**

- [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) `npm i -g pm2`
  - A process manager for Node apps.
- [tcpkali](https://github.com/machinezone/tcpkali) `brew install tcpkali`
  - A TCP/IP load testing tool
- [htop](https://hisham.hm/htop/) `brew install htop`
  - A cool process/memory monitor for you OSX
---

# Load Testing

### ðŸ”¥ Fire up your load testing suite

Open 3 separate terminals & run each of the following commands in it's own terminal window.

- **Start your node app using :** `pm2 start index.js` <br/> (from your project directory)
- **Start the pm2 monitor :** `pm2 monit`
- **Start htop :** `htop`

---

**Open a 4th terminal so that we can run the load testing tool.**
Your screen should look something like this:

<img src="/public/img/slide-assets/load-testing-setup.png" />

---

# Exercise 3

Run some load tests on your TCP Server and ovserve the following:
- System memory and CPU usage
- Node process memory and CPU usage
- The output returned from the server process

run the command: <br/>
`tcpkali -c 100 -d -m "$" -r 100 localhost:9000`

# Internet Messaging with Node

---

# Exercise 4

**Create a minimal Chat Server**

Change your TCP service to deliver any incoming data to all connected clients.

- Your server will need to store all connections
- Messages you send to the server should not return to you

---

# Process: Memory & CPU

Introducing the code reccomended on the previous slide may have intorduced a memory leak.
Run the load tester to find out!

- What do we have to do to prevent the memory leak?
