## Exercise 1

Let's explore the demo site and apply our knowledge of the template hierarchy.

Visit the inhabitent demo site at [LINK HERE](http://link.academy.red/).

Explore the site and using the WordPress template heiarchy, try to idenitfy the template files needed to build this theme. 

Write down these template files and how they correspond with the site.

## Project Activity

In today's project activity, use what we learned about custom WordPress theming to begin building out the website.

Copy the starter theme directory into **a new WP installation** on your computer where you are going to build out your project, and **rename the theme folder** something a bit more descriptive (e.g. `XXXXXXXX`).

In the [project assets folder](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/red-wdp/project-files/project-04.zip) you'll also find all of the content for the site. You'll need to add the content to your site via the WP admin area. **Start with posts!** You will find the featured image for each post in `_assets/images/blog-photos/`.
