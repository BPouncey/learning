# README

This is the readme file...we'll need to update it with more info before we launch in July.

## Development

Every learning materials repo will have two branches, but only one is used for active development.

- `master` for development. **All pull requests should be to submitted against `master`.**
- `production` for the Heroku-hosted site. **This branch is for deployment purposes only.**
