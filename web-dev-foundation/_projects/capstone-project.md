title: Capstone Project
due: Day 20 (beginning of class)
---

For the capstone project, you will either continue working on your Project 1/2 website, or build a new **responsively designed** website with at least three pages.

As with Project 1/2, you have creative control over the topic of your website, but please avoid fan site topics.

And like with Project 2, you'll also deploy your website using **GitHub Pages**. If you would prefer to purchase a custom domain name and website hosting plan to host your Capstone Project instead of using GitHub Pages, please make arrangements with your instructor in advance.
