title: Project 2 - Capstone
due: Day 20 (beginning of class)
---

For the capstone project, you will build a **responsive, mobile-first** website on a topic of your own choosing.

You have creative control over the topic of your website. Some ideas for your website topic may include:

- A simple website for a business or product
- A homepage for a local charity
- A website advertising an upcoming event
- *...or pitch an idea to your instructor!*

Be sure to submit your website topic idea to your instructor **before the beginning of class on Day 11**.

And like with Project 1, you'll also deploy your website using **GitHub Pages**. If you would prefer to purchase a custom domain name and website hosting plan to host your capstone project instead of using GitHub Pages, please make arrangements with your instructor in advance.
