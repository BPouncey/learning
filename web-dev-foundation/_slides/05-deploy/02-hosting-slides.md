Larger host is usually better as they can offer customer service.

# Set Name Servers

---

Now we need to tell your domain name to point to your new web host. 
First google “Yourwebhost” + Nameservers and get them,

*in my experience it has been ns1.yourhost.com and ns2.yourhost.com, 90% of the time.""

---

For Hover we also need the IP address, we can look it up here:
