# What is JavaScript?

---
class: center, middle

### JavaScript is a programming language

Computers need you to tell them what to do.

### JavaScript is not "Java"

The name is just an unfortunate remnant from the 1990s.

# Why Should I Use JavaScript?

---
class: center, middle

> "There are two answers. The first is that you don't have a choice...The other answer is that, despite it's deficiencies, *JavaScript is really good*."

From "JavaScript: The Good Parts"

---

# Client-side / Server-side

- Client-side scripts run in the **browser**
- For the most part, JS is the only ubiquitous client-side script today
- Server-side scripts run on a **server**
- PHP, Ruby, and Python run on the server side (but JS can run server-side as well today using Node.js)

# What Is Syntax?

- Syntax is the set of rules or "grammar" of a particular programming language
- It sets the rules that determine how your code should be structured so computers can understand it
- A text-based language's syntax will permit specific combinations of letter, numbers, and symbols
- Scratch was a "visual" programming language, not a text-based one like JS

# Syntax Highlighting

<!-- A bit of sample HTML with syntax highlighting-->

<html>
   <head>
      <title>An Awesome Website</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <h1>Hello world again!</h1>
      <p class="my-class">Just a little bit of sample code.</p>
   </body>
