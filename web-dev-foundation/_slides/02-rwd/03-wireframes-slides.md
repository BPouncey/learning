### What Not to Include
A wireframe *shouldn't* include ***colour scheme, fonts, background styles or any images.*** It focuses more on visual hierarchy of information and functional requirements such as accessibility are also addressed.

### Love to Sketch?
If you are an artist at heart, and enjoy doodling and drawing, you can always sketch your own wireframe out on paper and define the different areas of a page layout.  Be organized, tidy and keep elements to scale.
