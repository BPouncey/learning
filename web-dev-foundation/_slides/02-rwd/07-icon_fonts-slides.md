# What is Icon Fonts and Font Awesome?

---

Icons play an important role in web design, they are simple and convey a message, and add visual interest to a site.

Icons are used for:
- Social Media Icons
- Payment Icons (Visa. Mastercard, Carts)
- Navigation


---

Web developers previously used images as icons in the past, this worked when websites were non-responsive.

Issues are present when scaling , and different pixel densities (Retina), and were time consuming to manage, needing re-edits to make changes.

---

Enter Font Awesome - a free service  thats as simple  to use as adding two lines of code to your website

Like Google Web Fonts it is served off a Content Delivery Network (CDN),
