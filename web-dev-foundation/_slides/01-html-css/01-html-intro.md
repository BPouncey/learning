# What is HTML
Hyper Text Markup Language
---

## HTML Intro
**Hypertext**  is  a  system  of  clickable  text  links  that  let  you  view  information  in  a  non‐linear  way.    The  hypertext term has been updated to also include a non‐text link, such as a image or a button. Note that links  don’t  necessarily  always  get  you  to  another page,  a  hyperlink can also be set-up to run a script that can play a video or sound, or make something happen dynamically.

**Markup** is a term that refers to how text is supposed to be presented in the browser by way of placing different combination of tags around the text.

### JavaScript is not "Java"

The shared name is just a remnant from the 1990s.

# Client-side / Server-side

- Client-side scripts run in the **browser**
- For the most part, JS is the only client-side script today
- Server-side scripts run on a **server**
- PHP, Ruby, and Python run on the server side
- But JS can run server-side as well today using Node.js...
