# CSS Reset

---
## CSS Reset
- The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings.

---

# CSS Positioning
## Static, Relative, Absolute, Fixed

---
##CSS Positioning Types

****Static/Normal Flow****: Default behaviour of content on a page

****Relative****: Moves an element from its normal flow

****Absolute****: This element is removed from its normal flow, and moves in relation to its containing block.

****Fixed***: Positions the element with relation to the browser window, and does not move when page is scrolled. 

*See pg. 363-376 in your HTML/CSS text for further examples* 
---

## Z-Index
- The Z-Index property allows for elements to stack and overlap each other. The higher the z-index, the more closer the element is to the front, the smaller the number, the element will appear more in the background. 
---
## Common Web Formats

```html
<!-- A bit of sample HTML with syntax highlighting-->

<html>
   <head>
      <title>An Awesome Website</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <h1>Hello world again!</h1>
      <p class="my-class">Just a little bit of sample code.</p>
   </body>
</html>
```
