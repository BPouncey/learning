# CSS Positioning
## Static, Relative, Absolute, Fixed

---
##CSS Positioning Types

****Static/Normal Flow****: Default behaviour of content on a page
****Relative****: Moves an element from its normal flow
****Absolute****: This element is removed from its normal flow, and moves in relation to its containing block.
****Fixed***: Positions the element with relation to the browser window, and does not move when page is scrolled. 

*See pg. 363-376 in your HTML/CSS text for further examples*

## Z-Index
- The Z-Index property allows for elements to stack and overlap each other. The higher the z-index, the more closer the element is to the front, the smaller the number, the element will appear more in the background.
