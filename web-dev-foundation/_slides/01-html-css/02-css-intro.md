# Internal vs External CSS

---
## Internal CSS
- This type of style is applied to just single pages
- The style is placed within the head section of the html page

## External CSS
- This type of stylesheet is applied to multiple pages in the same site
- Allows for easy updating site wide
- Content is clearly separated from style

---
## Specificity

The more specific rules will take priority over the more general css rules. 
- !Important overrides previous same style
- Inline styles
- Selector Specificity
- Last Rule

---

## Inheritance

Inheritance is when styles get **inherited** by child elements from the parent element. This saves a lot of time rather than specifying the same styles for every element used.
