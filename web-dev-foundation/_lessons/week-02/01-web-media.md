## Exercise 1

If you haven't done so already, download and install an image editing application such as Adobe Photoshop or Gimp.

Next, download **[this image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jdhancock/12708712045/)**, open it in the image editor, and try:

- Resizing the image to be a maximum of 800px wide
- Cropping the image to have a 4:3 aspect ratio
- Saving the image to be optimized for web (can you make it less than 70KB without sacrificing too much quality?)

If you have additional time, explore other tools inside the image editor, like the rotate tool or text tool.

## Exercise 2

Try out some of the different web colour modes below:

## Lab Activity

In this lab activity, you're going to **practice you image-optimizing skills**.

You can either use images/graphics that you own, or you can explore sources for Creative Commons-licensed and public domain images/graphics.

**Choose at least three images/graphics** and experiment with the different editing tools you just learned. You are encouraged to explore a different file format for each.

Next, **add your newly web-optimized images to a webpage**. You can add them to your resume HTML file, you can create a new webpage if you like.

Finally, in an externally linked stylesheet, **practice using CSS to alter the display** of the image. Focus particularly on using box model properties to adjust its display, and be sure to **try out some HEX, RGBa, and HSLa colours** in your CSS as well.
