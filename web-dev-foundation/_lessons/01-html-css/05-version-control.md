- Run basic commands such as navigating the file system, and viewing and deleting files
- Create a Git repo locally, commit code, and push the code to remote repo on GitHub
- Level-up in Git by creating and merging branches

## Exercise 1

Time to roll up your sleeves and try out some commands!

You're going to do the following using the CLI only:

1. Make sure you have Terminal (Mac) or [cmder](http://gooseberrycreative.com/cmder) (Windows) installed
2. Try out the the `pwd` and `ls` commands
3. Navigate to your Desktop and create a directory called `website`
4. Create an `index.html` file inside of your new directory
5. Create an `assets` sub-directory in there too
6. Add a `style.css` file to `assets`
7. Delete the `assets` folder and its contents
8. Delete the `index.html` in the root of your `website` directory
9. Delete the `website` directory

## Exercise 2

Let's install Git together:

- You can check if you have Git installed already by running `git --version` on the command line
- If you don't have Git, we'll use the [GitHub method](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) to get you up and running right now
- You can install the [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/) app as well and log in with your GitHub credentials

## Exercise 3

Let's put some real code up on GitHub using the skills we just learned.

You're going to turn your Week 1 Project into a Git repo, and push it to GitHub.

You can use a GUI-based app to accomplish this, or if you're brave, try doing it entirely from the command line.

## Lab Activity

Lab time will be dedicated to working on [Project 1](/project/project-1/). Be sure to commit your changes to your Git repo as you work now!
