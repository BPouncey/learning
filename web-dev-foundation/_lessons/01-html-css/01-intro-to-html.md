- Install a text editor (eg. Sublime Text) and use it to open and edit HTML documents
- Learn to write semantic HTML, including elements, attributes, and nesting
- Use basic HTML tags including headings, paragraphs, links, and lists
- Recognize key differences between XHTML and HTML5

## Exercise 1

Now you've seen a few of the main types of code editors (Sublime, Atom, TextWranger, Notepad++), you will now **download** the code editor of your choice onto your laptop and get it installed. 

In the web developer course folder on your local computer, create a `local root folder` for today's in-class exercise/lab practice.

Set-up an simple `HTML page` in your code editor with all the basic structural tags (body, head, title), then include a few heading and paragraph tags before saving as `index.html`.

Preview in a browser of your choice by going to the File menu > File Open (browse for your `index.html` page.
 


## Exercise 2

*Instructions:*  `Edit this Codepen` and `Fork` the example while in the HTML panel. Go ahead and apply an example of each list type - Ordered and Unordered, add some headings/paragraphs to separate the pages into different sections , try out the `<hr>` horizontal rule and insert some `<br>` linebreaks throughout!

## Exercise 3
*Instructions:*  `Edit this Codepen` and `Fork` the example while in the HTML panel.
This time, add some **semantic tags** like `emphasis`, `strong`, try out some `external links` to your favourite sites, and even `insert an image` with **alt** tag.

## Lab Activity
Using this [Star Wars Formatting Lab Activity](/public/files/labs/01-html-formatting-lab.zip) (zipped), you'll be using your new found coding skills to `mark-up` the text using what you've learnt in the morning class using a combination of tags covered. Open your `code editor` and `create` a new HTML document that has the doctype, body, head, and title tags. Your task will be to try to **match the formatting** style of the *formatted Word* document, using the *plain text* Word version and the HTML mark-up tags below:

- Headings and Paragraphs
- Linebreaks & Horizontal Rules
- Links
- Basic Lists
- Semantic Tags: Emphasis and Strong
- Nested Tags
- Inserting Images

[comment]: Insert a visual image of the end result of the page to style

*Match the visual example* provided as closely as possible.  You will have a chance to practice using the following tags: paragraphs, headers, line‐breaks, strong, emphasis, links as well as others that the instructor has shown in class today. There are no images are required for this exercise.
