## Exercise 1

Your turn! Time to create your first webpage.

First things first...you need to pick a code editor to download and install it (if you haven't done so already).

Next create a root folder somewhere on our computer and save a new file called `index.html`.

Then open that folder and create a simple webpage containing `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>` and `<body>` tags, then add a few paragraphs of text.

Lastly, save and view your new website in a browser.

## Exercise 2

Try marking up this block text as instructed. If you haven't created a Codepen account yet, do that right now and complete this exercise by clicking "Edit on Codepen", and create a "Fork" of the pen to save your answer to your account.

## Lab Activity

Using this [Star Wars Formatting Lab Activity](/public/files/labs/01-html-formatting-lab.zip) (zipped), you'll be using your new found coding skills to `mark-up` the text using what you've learnt in the morning class using a combination of tags covered. Open your `code editor` and `create` a new HTML document that has the doctype, body, head, and title tags. Your task will be to try to **match the formatting** style of the *formatted Word* document, using the *plain text* Word version and the HTML mark-up tags below:

- Headings and Paragraphs
- Linebreaks & Horizontal Rules
- Links
- Basic Lists
- Semantic Tags: Emphasis and Strong
- Nested Tags
- Inserting Images

*Match the visual example* provided as closely as possible.  You will have a chance to practice using the following tags: paragraphs, headers, line‐breaks, strong, emphasis, links as well as others that the instructor has shown in class today. There are no images are required for this exercise.
Please save your file as: **firstname_html_assign1.html**
