## Exercise 1

Your turn! Time to create your first webpage.

First things first...you need to pick a code editor to download and install it (if you haven't done so already).

Next create a root folder somewhere on our computer and save a new file called `index.html`.

Then open that folder and create a simple webpage containing `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>` and `<body>` tags, then add a few paragraphs of text.

Lastly, save and view your new website in a browser.

## Exercise 2

Try marking up this block text as instructed. If you haven't created a Codepen account yet, do that right now and complete this exercise by clicking "Edit on Codepen", and create a "Fork" of the pen to save your answer to your account.

## Lab Activity

For this activity, you're going to **turn your resume into an HTML document**.

You will **use your code editor** to create a new HTML document that has the HTML5 doctype set, and has `html`, `head`, `title`, and `body` elements.

From there, **mark up the content in your resume** using the following HTML elements:

- headings
- paragraphs
- basic lists (ordered or unordered)
- horizontal rules
- links (include at least two)
- strong and emphasis

Be careful when you're nesting your tags, and don't forget to save your resume file as `index.html` inside of your root project folder.
