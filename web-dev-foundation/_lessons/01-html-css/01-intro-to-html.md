## Exercise 1

Work through this activity in class:

Using this *Codepen HTML Exercise 1* (this has the doctype, body, head, title tags all set up, you won't need to add them to the code view), you will add **paragraphs & headers** to modify the text content in the passage. Consider applying italics, strong, and line-breaks for further practice.

## Lab Activity
Using the preset **HTML template** (this has the doctype, body, head, title tags all set up),  markup the text as a HTML5 document using best practices discussed in the morning using a combination of headers, sections, articles, and footer elements, as well as proper nested basic elements.


[comment]: Insert a visual image of the end result of the page to style

*Match the visual example* provided as closely as possible.  You will have a chance to practice using the following tags: paragraphs, headers, line‐breaks, strong, emphasis, links as well as others that the instructor has shown in class today. There are no images are required for this exercise.
Please save your file as: **firstname_html_assign1.html**
