### Setting up a Root Folder ###

Creating HTML webpages requires some planning ahead of time of what you are planning to put in your page, and especially with media files, such as picture, graphics, sound, movies,  they  need  to  be  placed  in  their  respective  folders  or  sub‐folders before you plan to reference/(link) them in your HTML file.  Many linking issues will arise if the desired media file is not placed in the root folder before it is referenced.


## File & Folder Naming Recommendations ##
- Stick to lowercase consistently
- Do not use SPACES in your file names, instead use hyphens- or underscores_
to separate words
- Do not use any symbols (such as #@*&><) in your file name
- Choose a logical, descriptive, and standard convention names
- Stick either to .html or .htm, but don’t flip‐flop between them

## Exercise 1

Work through this activity in class:

Using this *Codepen HTML Exercise 1* (this has the doctype, body, head, title tags all set up, you won't need to add them to the code view), you will add **paragraphs & headers** to modify the text content in the passage. Consider applying italics, strong, and line-breaks for further practice.

## Exercise 2

Work through this next activity in class:

Using this *[Codepen Exercise 2]* (this has the doctype, body, head, title tags all set up, you won't need to add them to the code view), you will add **examples of links** to modify the text content in the passage. Apply internal, external, email and anchor links to your page for further practice.

## Lab Activity
Using the preset **HTML template** (this has the doctype, body, head, title tags all set up),  markup the text as a HTML5 document using best practices discussed in the morning using a combination of headers, sections, articles, and footer elements, as well as proper nested basic elements.

[comment]: Insert a visual image of the end result of the page to style

*Match the visual example* provided as closely as possible.  You will have a chance to practice using the following tags: paragraphs, headers, line‐breaks, strong, emphasis, links as well as others that the instructor has shown in class today. There are no images are required for this exercise.
Please save your file as: **firstname_html_assign1.html**
