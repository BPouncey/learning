## Exercise 1

Now let's try putting jQuery effects together with form inputs:

<iframe height='268' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/redacademy/embed/xGVmEq/?height=268&theme-id=0&default-tab=js' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/redacademy/pen/xGVmEq/'>xGVmEq</a> by RED Academy (<a href='http://codepen.io/redacademy'>@redacademy</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

## Homework

For homework, you're going to use what you just learned about HTML forms and jQuery animation to try to recreate this form:

![Form prototype](/public/files/labs/jquery-form-lab.gif)

You're welcome to use either **Codepen** or a **code editor** to complete this assignment.

Your cheatsheet:

- The body background colour is `#567567`
- The login form background colour is `#f0f0f0`
- The input border colour is `#cccccc`
- The button colour is `##3399cc`
- The button hover colour is `#2288bb`
- The entire form should appear or disappear each time the button is clicked

Wondering how to create **triangle shapes** with CSS? You'll want to read this tutorial:

- [CSS Triangle](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/)

Lastly, the typeface used in the form is called **Open Sans**. You can include from Google Fonts by pasting this at the top of your stylesheet:

```css
@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:300);
```

Good luck!
