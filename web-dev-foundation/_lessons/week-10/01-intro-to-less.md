## Exercise 1

Let's refactor some plain vanilla CSS into Less:

<iframe height='268' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/redacademy/embed/NqdjQP/?height=268&theme-id=0&default-tab=css' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/redacademy/pen/NqdjQP/'>NqdjQP</a> by RED Academy (<a href='http://codepen.io/redacademy'>@redacademy</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

## Exercise 2

Let's take the Less that you wrote in Exercise 1 and practice compiling it.

To do that, you'll need to:

1. Download and install [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) (or try the CLI!)
2. Download the zip file of your solution on Codepen for Exercise 1, or download the zip of the provided solution
3. Extract the zip file and set-up a new project in Koala with the resulting folder
4. Compile away!
