## Pre-work

Readings from *Learn to Code HTML & CSS*:

- [Building Your First Web Page](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/)
- [Getting to Know HTML](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-html/)
- [Creating Lists](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/creating-lists/) (HTML section only)

Before the first class, also be sure to work through all of the free modules in Codeacademy's [HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web) tutorial.

## Learning Objectives

- Define what a mark-up language is and the function of HTML on the web.
- Write well-structured HTML by properly nesting elements and applying appropriate attributes to them.
- Use basic HTML elements including headings, paragraphs, links, and lists.
- Use the HTML5 doctype and elements to semantically structure a web page.

## Exercise 1

Your turn! Time to create your first webpage.

First things first...you need to pick a code editor to download and install it (if you haven't done so already).

Next create a root folder somewhere on our computer and save a new file called `index.html`.

Then open that folder and create a simple webpage containing `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>` and `<body>` tags, then add a few paragraphs of text.

Lastly, save and view your new website in a browser.

## Exercise 2

Try marking up this block text as instructed. If you haven't created a Codepen account yet, do that right now and complete this exercise by clicking "Edit on Codepen", and create a "Fork" of the pen to save your answer to your account.

## Exercise 3

Now try using an assortment of structural and semantic tags:

## Exercise 4

Let's dive right in and start thinking about how we might tackle the first project's design comp to convert it into semantically-appropriate HTML elements.

Jot some idea out on your own, then you'll pair up to discuss your approach with a partner. Based on this discussion, is there anything you'd revise in your approach?

Finally, you and your partner will share your insights with the class.

## Homework

For homework, please begin marking-up the HTML for your Project 1.

Before you get started, you should watch these videos to reinforce the concepts learned in class:

- [HTML - Hamburger Mark-up Language](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/02-html/)
- [Don't Fear Starting from Scratch - Part 1: HTML](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/04-from-scratch/)

Use what we've learned about paragraphs, headings, lists, links, and images to rough-out the structure of the site. You don't need to worry about the table or the Google Map at this time unless you're feeling ambitious!

Be careful when you're nesting your tags, and don't forget to save your resume file as `index.html` inside of your root project folder.

It's OK if it doesn't look beautiful yet! We'll start learning about CSS in the next class.
