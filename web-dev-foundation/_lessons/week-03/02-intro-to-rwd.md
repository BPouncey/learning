## Learning Objectives

- Explore what responsive web design (RWD) is, and how it differs from creating a “mobile-only” website.
- Understand the difference between fixed, fluid, adaptive, and responsive websites.
- Understand how to use a “mobile-first” approach to web development.
- Use media queries to manipulate website styles at various "breakpoints".

## Exercise 1

Try converting a fixed layout to flexible layout:

<iframe height='268' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/redacademy/embed/WvozXj/?height=268&theme-id=0&default-tab=css' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/redacademy/pen/WvozXj/'>WvozXj</a> by RED Academy (<a href='http://codepen.io/redacademy'>@redacademy</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

---

## Exercise 2

Write your first media query:

<iframe height='268' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/redacademy/embed/OVvXWV/?height=268&theme-id=0&default-tab=css' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/redacademy/pen/OVvXWV/'>OVvXWV</a> by RED Academy (<a href='http://codepen.io/redacademy'>@redacademy</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

## Exercise 3

Time to try out creating mobile-first media queries for yourself:

<iframe height='268' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/redacademy/embed/qdqoKG/?height=268&theme-id=0&default-tab=css' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/redacademy/pen/qdqoKG/'>qdqoKG</a> by RED Academy (<a href='http://codepen.io/redacademy'>@redacademy</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.

## Exercise 4

Now that we've had a chance to learn some RWD skills, let's strategize how we'll apply this to our Project 1.

Take a few moments to review the two narrower design comps and think about what areas of the site will specifically be affected by the changes that are happening at each breakpoint.

Jot some idea out on your own, then you'll team up to discuss this with a partner. We'll then reconvene to discuss each other's findings, as well as any questions or concerns.

## Homework

For homework, you'll start to refactor your project to be a responsive, mobile-first website.

Review the project requirements to determine what breakpoints you'll need to optimize for.

Refactoring your desktop-only, fixed width CSS will be tricky, but stick with it! When you're done, you'll definitely see the advantage of writing mobile-first media queries right from the start of a project. 

And don't forget to **change static units** `px` units into relative units like `em/rem` and `%` wherever possible!
