## Exercise 1

Go to **[Unmatched Style](http://unmatchedstyle.com/)** again and pick a website to reductively transform into a wireframe.

Using some of the provided wireframe sketch paper, sketch what you think a wireframe should look like for the desktop width of that website.

If you have time, try sketching out wireframes for its mobile phone and tablet widths too.

## Homework

For homework you will produce a set of **wireframes for Project 2**.

Start by **sketching out wireframes on paper** for each of the three required breakpoints (for at least one page).

Once you've completed paper sketches, select one of the recommended wireframing tools and **produce a digital version of your wireframes** for each breakpoint.

You are encouraged to **seek out some inspiration** from other well-designed responsive websites on how to re-layout the elements on your pages at the different breakpoints. Check out [Media Queries](http://mediaqueri.es/) and [Unmatched Style](http://unmatchedstyle.com/tag/responsive) for galleries of RWD case studies.
