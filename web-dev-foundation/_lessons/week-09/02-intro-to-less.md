## Exercise 1

Let's refactor some plain vanilla CSS in to Less:

<iframe height='268' scrolling='no' src='//codepen.io/redacademy/embed/NqdjQP/?height=268&theme-id=0&default-tab=css' frameborder='no' allowtransparency='true' allowfullscreen='true' style='width: 100%;'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/redacademy/pen/NqdjQP/'>NqdjQP</a> by RED Academy (<a href='http://codepen.io/redacademy'>@redacademy</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

View the [solution](http://codepen.io/redacademy/pen/WvROjx).

## Exercise 2

Let's take the Less that you wrote in Exercise 1 and practice compiling it using Prepos.

To do that, you'll need:

1. Download and install [Prepos](https://prepros.io/)
2. Download the zip file of your solution on Codepen for Exercise 1, or download the zip of the provided solution
3. Extract the zip file and set-up a new project in Prepos with the resulting folder
4. Compile away!

## Lab Activity

Lab activity time will be dedicated to working on the [Capstone Project](/project/capstone-project/).
