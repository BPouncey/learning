## Exercise 1

Let's try creating colour palettes based on the colour harmony rules we just learned.

If you haven't done so already, create an **[Adobe Color CC](https://color.adobe.com/)** account and create at least five different colour palettes each based on a different colour harmony rule.

Don't limit yourself based on the built-in colour rules in the web app&mdash;be sure to try out some of the others you just learned too.

## Exercise 2

Go to **[Unmatched Style](http://unmatchedstyle.com/)** and find an example of what you think is a well-designed website.

Jot down some notes about how it uses the elements and principles of design in terms of its layout and overall visual design.

After a few minutes evaluating your chosen website, team up with another class member and exchange your observations.

## Exercise 3

Go to **[Unmatched Style](http://unmatchedstyle.com/)** again and pick a website to reductively transform into a wireframe.

Using some of the provided wireframe sketch paper, sketch what you think a wireframe should look like for the desktop width of that website.

If you have time, try sketching out wireframes for its mobile phone and tablet widths too.

Tip: Choose a website with some interesting layout features!

## Exercise 4

Try out one of the recommended wireframing tools for this lesson, and quickly mock-up a wireframe based on the desktop sketch that you produced in the last exercise.
