## Exercise 1

Let's try creating colour palettes based on the colour harmony rules we just learned.

If you haven't done so already, create an **[Adobe Color CC](https://color.adobe.com/)** account and create at least five different colour palettes each based on a different colour harmony rule.

Don't limit yourself based on the built-in colour rules in the web app&mdash;be sure to try out some of the other you just learned too.

## Exercise 2

Go to **[Unmatched Style](http://unmatchedstyle.com/)** and find an example of what you think is a well-designed website.

Jot down some notes about how it uses the elements and principles of design in terms of its layout and overall visual design.

After a few minutes evaluating your chosen website, team up with another class member and exchange your observations.
